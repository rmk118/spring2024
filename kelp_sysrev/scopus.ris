AB  - Macroalgae (seaweeds) represent an emerging resource for food and the production of commodity and specialty chemicals. In this study, a single-step microwave process was used to depolymerise a range of macroalgae native to the United Kingdom, producing a growth medium suitable for microbial fermentation. The medium contained a range of mono- and polysaccharides as well as macro- and micronutrients that could be metabolised by the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Among twelve macroalgae species, the brown seaweeds exhibited the highest fermentation potential, especially the kelp Saccharina latissima. Applying a portfolio of ten native M. pulcherrima strains, yeast growth kinetics, as well as production of lipids and 2-phenylethanol were examined, with productivity and growth rate being strain dependent. On the 2 L scale, 6.9 g L−1 yeast biomass – a yield of 0.14 g g−1 with respect to the supplied macroalgae – containing 37.2% (w/w) lipid was achieved through utilisation of the proteins, mono- and polysaccharides from S. latissima, with no additional enzymes. In addition, the yeast degraded a range of fermentation inhibitors released upon microwave processing at high temperatures and long holding times. As macroalgae can be cultured to food grade, this system offers a novel, potentially low-cost route to edible microbial oils as well as a renewable feedstock for oleochemicals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Macroalgae may comprise an alternative feed resource to ruminant animals contributing to a more sustainable livestock production. A wide range of effects on the ruminal fermentation parameters have been reported in short-term in vitro studies, but longer term fermentations are scarce and their effects on the rumen function remain largely unknown. Hypothesizing that ruminal fermentation might be differently affected by the extent of the in vitro fermentations, the present study investigated the effects of Ulva rigida, Gracilaria vermiculophylla, and Saccharina latissima inclusion on gas and methane production, on fermentation parameters, digestibility, and bacterial fatty acids in a RUSITEC system, after a potential adaptation of the rumen microbes to the experimental treatments. Green (U. rigida), red (G. vermiculophylla) or brown (S. latissima) macroalgae produced in an integrated multitrophic aquaculture system were included at 25% (dry matter basis) in a single total mixed ration (TMR) diet and incubated in a RUSITEC system along with a control (100% TMR) over an experimental period of 8 days, following an adaptation period of 7 days. Macroalgae inclusion did not affect gas and methane production. Volatile fatty acids production was not affected by macroalgae but its profile was; the proportion of acetic acid increased and that of propionic acid and butyric acid decreased. Compared to control, macroalgae inclusion only reduced the fermentation efficiency by 1%. The inclusion of macroalgae increased the dry matter and organic matter digestibility, decreased the crude protein digestibility, and did not affect the neutral detergent fiber digestibility. The odd- and branched-fatty acids profile of the bacteria associated to the solid or the liquid fractions was not affected by macroalgae inclusion. Overall, the absence of effects on rumen fermentation suggest U. rigida, G. vermiculophylla, and S. latissima to be suitable alternative feed ingredients to be used in ruminant nutrition up to 25% inclusion. © 2019

AB  - Background: There has been a rapid increase in the number of seaweed farms in the Western world, and it is crucial for these companies and their customers to have standardized methods for quality assessment and optimization. The aim of this study was to adapt known methods for food-quality determination for the analysis of seaweed quality, including color, texture, and microbiology, and to discuss optimal heat treatments for the popular macroalgae Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta. Results: The development of an attractive, green color during heating was highly specific to species, freezing history, and part of the thallus. Resilience and thermostability were also species dependent. Low microbial numbers (1–3 log cfu/g) for total aerobic count, psychrotrophic bacteria, and spore-forming bacteria were found, but Bacillus spp. were isolated. No enterococci, coliforms, pathogenic vibrios, or Listeria monocytogenes were detected. Conclusion: The methods employed were able to describe clearly the physical and microbial qualities of A. esculenta and S. latissima, and quality changes during processing. Based on the results, optimal cooking for a minimum of 15 min at 95 °C was suggested for S. latissima. Fresh and frozen A. esculenta showed the greenest color after heating for 5–9 s at a high temperature (> 85 °C). If a higher heat load is needed to achieve safe and stable food products, using fresh and not frozen A. esculenta is highly recommended, as fresh specimens remain green even after 15 min at 95 °C. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Marine microorganisms play key roles in every marine ecological process, hence the growing interest in studying their populations and functions. Microbial communities on algae remain underexplored, however, despite their huge biodiversity and the fact that they differ markedly from those living freely in seawater. The study of this microbiota and of its relationships with algal hosts should provide crucial information for ecological investigations on algae and aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, because these microorganisms interact with algae in multiple, complex ways, they constitute an interesting source of novel bioactive compounds with biotechnological potential, such as dehalogenases, antimicrobials, and alga-specific polysaccharidases (e.g., agarases, carrageenases, and alginate lyases). Here, to demonstrate the huge potential of alga-associated organisms and their metabolites in developing future biotechnological applications, we first describe the immense diversity and density of these microbial biofilms. We further describe their complex interactions with algae, leading to the production of specific bioactive compounds and hydrolytic enzymes of biotechnological interest. We end with a glance at their potential use in medical and industrial applications. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is recognized as a green method for extraction of natural products. The current research aimed to explore the MAE for fucoidans extraction from different brown seaweeds, including Fucus vesiculosus, F. spiralis, and Laminaria saccharina. Following several solvent-extraction pre-treatment steps and MAE optimization, the algal biomasses were extracted in a ratio of 1:25 in 0.1 M HCl containing 2 M CaCl2 for 1.0 min. The results showed that L. saccharina’s extract was different from the others, regarding the highest sugar content reached 0.47 mg glucose equivalent/mg extract being confirmed by monosaccharide composition analysis and the lowest fucoidan content and sulfation degree at 0.09 mg/mg extract and 0.13, respectively. Moreover, these findings were confirmed by tentative structural elucidation based on Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry which also showed a different spectrum. However, the MAE enhanced melanoidins formation in products, which was confirmed by the intense band at 1420 cm−1. Interestingly, the results of monomeric composition showed that fucoidan extract by MAE from F. vesiculosus belonged to sulfated galactofucans which are known for their potential bioactivities. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity of the four fucoidans in concentrations ranging from 4.9 µg/mL to 2500 µg/mL was investigated and correlated with the chemical characterization showing that F. vesiculosus_MAE fucoidan was the most potent and safest. The current research revealed the chemical heterogeneity of fucoidans regarding taxonomical class and used greener extraction method of fucoidans toward the achievement of the UN sustainability goals. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Kelp species are distributed along ~ 25% of the world’s coastlines and the forests they form represent some of the world’s most productive and diverse ecosystems. Like other marine habitat–formers, the associated microbial community is fundamental for host and, in turn, wider ecosystem functioning. Given there are thousands of bacteria-host associations, determining which relationships are important remains a major challenge. We characterised the associated bacteria of two habitat-forming kelp species, Laminaria hyperborea and Saccharina latissima, from eight sites across a range of spatial scales (10 s of metres to 100 s of km) in the northeast Atlantic. We found no difference in diversity or community structure between the two kelps, but there was evidence of regional structuring (across 100 s km) and considerable variation between individuals (10 s of metres). Within sites, individuals shared few amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and supported a very small proportion of diversity found across the wider study area. However, consistent characteristics between individuals were observed with individual host communities containing a small conserved “core” (8–11 ASVs comprising 25 and 32% of sample abundances for L. hyperborea and S. latissima, respectively). At a coarser taxonomic resolution, communities were dominated by four classes (Planctomycetes, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia) that made up ~ 84% of sample abundances. Remaining taxa (47 classes) made up very little contribution to overall abundance but the majority of taxonomic diversity. Overall, our study demonstrates the consistent features of kelp bacterial communities across large spatial scales and environmental gradients and provides an ecologically meaningful baseline to track environmental change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The effect of high pressure processing (HPP) at 400 and 600 MPa for 5 min on Laminaria ochroleuca (kombu seaweed) shelf-life during storage at 4 °C for 180 days was investigated. Viable bacterial counts increased in untreated kombu from 5.42 log cfu/g on day 1 to 8.47 log cfu/g on day 60 while they declined in HPP-treated kombu to 2.53–3.62 log cfu/g on day 1 and remained below 3 log cfu/g during storage. Salting with 40% marine salt and freezing at −24 °C also achieved significant decreases of viable bacterial counts, to levels of 3.94 and 2.75 log cfu/g, respectively, on day 60. Kombu pH, dry matter, water activity, colour parameters and texture parameters were significantly influenced by the preservation procedure. Total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of kombu samples did not differ on day 1, but on day 180 frozen kombu retained 71.9% of the initial polyphenol content versus 18.7–19.3% in HPP samples and 14.2% in salted samples, and 78.7% of the initial antioxidant capacity versus 22.2–23.1% in HPP samples and 18.3% in salted samples. Proteolytic activity and aminopeptidase activity were more affected by HPP than by salting or freezing on day 1, although all the samples showed similar values afterwards. Industrial relevance: HPP, salting and freezing showed to be valid preservation procedures from the point of view of kombu microbiological quality, achieving a shelf-life of at least 180 days. Total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity remained at higher levels in frozen kombu than in HPP and salted kombu after storage for 180 days. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The most common early complication after total laryngectomy is pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF). However, there are no reports of PCF after total laryngectomy caused by 'Kombu' (edible seaweed) as a foreign body in the digestive tract. A 68-year-old Japanese man had undergone total laryngectomy 5 years previously. He presented with PCF, neck swelling and pain. Video endoscopy showed that a dark green foreign body obstructed the digestive tract. PCF was successfully treated via emergency surgery comprising abscess drainage, foreign body removal and fistula closure. The foreign body was kombu. Clinicians who perform total laryngectomy should know the potential dangers of consuming hygroscopic food items that can cause bolus obstruction of the upper digestive tract and pharyngeal abscess and perforation. © © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019.

AB  - The microbiota of eight species (Chondrus crispus, Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria ochroleuca, Palmaria palmata, Porphyra umbilicalis, Saccharina latissima, Ulva lactuca and Undaria pinnatifida) of edible seaweeds collected in North West Spain, marketed as dehydrated product, was quantitatively determined on nine solid media. Representative colonies were selected from solid culture media. The isolated microorganisms were identified by means of morphological characteristics, 16S rDNA sequencing and biochemical tests. U. pinnatifida was the seaweed species showing the most abundant microbial population, with counts on Marine agar up to 7.7 log cfu/g in individual samples and 5.0 log cfu/g as the mean value, and counts of coliforms up to 4.6 log cfu/g in individual samples and 2.4 log cfu/g as the mean value. The 225 identified bacterial isolates belonged to 11 families, 27 genera and 56 species. Bacillaceae was the family accounting for the highest number of isolates (111) followed by Enterobacteriaceae (60), Bacillales Family XII Incertae Sedis (20), Planococcaceae (11), Moraxellaceae (7), Paenibacillaceae (5) and Pseudomonadaceae (5). Bacterial species showing the highest occurrence in dehydrated seaweeds were Bacillus megaterium, B. licheniformis, Pantoea sp. and termoresistant Pantoea sp. Four of the Bacillus species isolated from dehydrated seaweeds (B. cereus, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus and B. subtilis) are among those containing strains considered to be foodborne pathogens and nine of the isolated non-Bacillales bacterial species have been reported to contain human opportunistic pathogenic strains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The revised Bathing Water Directive (rBWD) introduces more stringent standards for microbial water quality and promotes more pro-active management of the beach environment through the production of a bathing water profile (BWP). The aim of this study was to determine whether living seaweeds in the littoral zone are colonised by faecal indicator organisms (FIOs), and to quantify the survival dynamics of waterborne Escherichia coli in microcosms containing senescing seaweeds. Living seaweed (Fucus spiralis) was not associated with FIO colonisation, although could be providing a protected environment in the underlying sand. Senescing seaweeds enhanced waterborne E. coli survival compared to plastic debris, with the brown seaweed Laminaria saccharina facilitating greater E. coli persistence than either Chondrus crispus or Ulva lactuca. This has important implications for FIO survival on bathing beaches as the majority of beach-cast biomass is composed of brown seaweeds, which could support significant levels of FIOs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, determination of chemical elements and heavy metals in seaweed extracts of wakame, arame, dulse, laminaria, kombu, and hijiki. Antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH method and the activity ranged from 0.00 to 2641.34 TEAC. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in kombu (2641.34 TEAC) and arame (2457.5 TEAC). Antimicrobial activity was analyzed by disk diffusion method and MIC method. Three G+ bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus sub-tilis), three G‐ bacteria (Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), and four yeasts (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. albicans) were used as model organisms. The size of inhibition zones ranged from 0.00 to 8.67 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the selected seaweeds ranged from MIC50 98.46 (MIC90 100.25) to MIC50 3.43 μL/mL (MIC90 5.26 μL/mL). The content of selected elements was determined in seaweed samples by ICP‐OES. The chemical composition of the algae showed differences between species and the presence of heavy metals. Arsenic, cadmium, and aluminum were confirmed. All seaweed samples contained arsenic ranging from 6.6546 to 76.48 mg/kg. Further investigation of seaweeds is needed to identify the active sub-stances present in the algae that are responsible for antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. This study was carried out to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of extracts from five commonly consumed seaweeds for their ability to inhibit selected microorganisms and to determine the health risk due to heavy metals content. Our study contributes to the evidence that seaweeds have antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and seaweed extracts have for pharmacological appli-cations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Paranosema locustae, an entomopathogen of grasshoppers and locusts, remains the only microsporidium registered as a biocontrol agent. After introductions from North America, it became established in grasshopper communities of Argentina. We measured the infection intensity of field collected, heavily infected male and female adults of individuals belonging to six grasshopper species, five melanoplines (Melanoplinae) (Baeacris pseudopunctulatus, Dichroplus maculipennis, Dichroplus vittatus, Neopedies brunneri, Scotussa lemniscata), and one gomphocerine (Gomphocerinae) (Staurorhectus longicornis). Average spore load among heavily infected grasshoppers ranged from 8.7±0.5×107 to 1.1±0.7×109. Only females of B. pseudopunctulatus and S. longicornis showed significantly higher spore loads than the males. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To investigate the effect of seasonal variation on macroalgae biomass characteristics and its related energy content, four different algae species, two from the Fucales order (Fucus vesiculosus and Ascophyllum nodosum), and two from the Laminariales order (Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta), were harvested during spring, summer, autumn and winter over one year. The biomethane potential and the elemental composition were determined for all samples. Both Fucales species showed low biodegradability (<30%) with methane yields consistently below 20 Nm3 per wet tonne. Laminariales species, however, allowed up to 80% biodegradation efficiency, with methane yields varying between 20 and 70 Nm3 per wet tonne depending on the harvesting season. For each of the four algae the biomass concentrations of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, sulphur, aluminium and iron was higher during spring/summer compared to autumn/winter. For heavy metals, variation was seen mainly for arsenic with higher values during autumn/winter. The highest values were observed for Laminariales (30–120 mg/kg total solids). Modelling the co-digestion of each algae with municipal wastewater sludge showed Laminariales species having the greatest potential as a profitable substrate for additional biomethane production generating up to 0.38 million Euro. However, seasonal variation could affect this expected income over 60% due to fluctuation in biomethane yields and biodegradability efficiency. Furthermore, the additional loading of cadmium and arsenic into the AD process suggested possible limitation for digestate utilisation in arable lands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To adapt to climate change and water scarcity during dry, hot summers, more sustainable, or even deficit, irrigation is required in the ornamental sector, as it uses large amounts of water to sustain high-value crop production. Biostimulants, especially seaweed extracts, could offer a sustainable solution against drought stress as they are known to increase plant tolerance to abiotic stress. The effect of four seaweed extracts based on Ascophyllum nodosum, Soliera chordalis, Ecklonia maxima, and Saccharina latissima and one microbial biostimulant were tested on container-grown Hydrangea paniculata under drought stress conditions for two years. During the first trial year, in 2019, overall irrigation was reduced by 20%. In 2021, plants were subjected to repeated drying and wetting cycles. In general, less irrigation, and thus a lower substrate moisture content, reduced stomatal conductance, biomass production, and root development, but increased plant compactness. The biostimulants showed minor effects, but these were not observed in both experiments. Treatment with the A. nodosum extract resulted in longer branches and more biomass under deficit irrigation but tended to accelerate flowering when repeated drying and wetting cycles were applied. The E. maxima extract negatively affected the branching of Hydrangea under repeated drying and wetting cycles. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Seaweed farming is a growing industry worldwide, and its sustainable management requires detailed knowledge about the environmental implications of detrital release. This study investigates benthic degradation of kelp detritus in defaunated mesocosms. The degradation dynamics were investigated over several weeks by resolving O2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes as a function of detritus amendments (0.15 g wet weight [WW] m-2 to 1 kg WW m-2), temperature (8 and 15°C), and presence of O2 for 2 commercially important kelp species: Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta. Kelp fragments were deposited in 2 different ways to simulate oxic and anoxic degradation: on the sediment surface (surface amendments) and just below the oxic surface sediment layer (subsurface amendments). All amendments resulted in high initial O2 consumption followed by an exponential decrease in O2 uptake over time. The degradation rates increased linearly with the amount of kelp added for both species and for both types of amendments. S. latissima expressed higher decay constants across all experiments and had a higher percentage turnover of carbon. In some instances, microbial priming apparently enabled enhanced degradation of preexisting resilient sedimentary carbon. The absolute degradation rates of kelp were reduced in the absence of O2, and sulfate reduction resulted in gradual accumulation of iron sulfide. Lower ambient temperature reduced the benthic mineralization rate of both kelp species, particularly during the initial incubation stages. The current study demonstrates the importance of key variables for microbial kelp degradation in marine sediments and their dynamics — variables that should be carefully considered when assessing environmental implications of seaweed farming. © The authors 2023.

AB  - Low seaweed consumption in the West is due to lack of availability and consumer famil-iarity. In this study, the effects of preservation processes on quality aspects of Saccharina latissima products were assessed. First, a blanching (100◦ C for 1 or 3 min) treatment was used to produce seaweed salad. In a second study, effects of blanching, freezing, and fermentation on kelp quality were assessed and processed kelp was used to produce sauerkraut. Blanching significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.05) the instrumental kelp a* value and firmness. The a* value negatively correlated with overall liking of salads. To prepare sauerkraut, raw, raw/frozen (−20◦ C), blanched (100◦ C, 1 min), or blanched/frozen kelp were mixed with cabbage, salted, inoculated with starter cultures and fermented. Inconsistent trends in L* values, firmness, and fungi enumeration were observed after fermentation. Consumers evaluated kelp salad (n = 100) and sauerkraut (n = 80) for acceptability. Blanched kelp salad had higher hedonic scores than raw kelp salad. A 100% cabbage sauerkraut control and blanched kelp/cabbage blends were compared; kelp blends were similar to control for appearance, color, and texture but were lower for overall acceptability. Results suggest improved quality and enhanced consumer acceptability of seaweed products with use of minimal processing. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Two seaweed species were examined (Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima) as a fermentation feedstock for the development of a beverage. Three microbial groups were selected for experimentation; a single-species bacterium; Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, a single-species yeast; Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a multi-species culture; kombucha SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast). Results showed SCOBY cultures were more successful in fermenting A. esculenta than S. latissima due to the lowered glucose content (4.069 ± 0.174 mg / mL and 12.224 ± 2.249 mg / mL, respectively). Likewise, L. plantarum played a major role in fermenting S. latissima, over A. esculenta, resulting in a lowered pH in the former but not the latter (6.44 ± 0.040 and 4.825 ± 0.045, respectively). S. cerevisiae does not appear to have been suitable as a fermentation medium for these two seaweed species under these conditions due to the lack of pH lowering, glucose reduction and acid production. All treatments showed an increased production of lactic acid, especially the SCOBY treated samples, which is an indicator of fermentation. There is potential for optimization of the seaweed fermentation process through strain selection, fermentation conditions optimization (temperature, time, pH) and seaweed biomass pretreatment. Glutamic acid, the amino acid responsible for umami flavour, was found in greater quantities in the S. cerevisiae treated seaweed, indicating that fermentation using S. cerevisiae cultures may improve the umami flavour profile of a seaweed fermented beverage product. In order to see if the seaweed species used had an impact on the SCOBY microbial makeup, the DNA profiles of the two SCOBYs used were analyzed. There were significant differences between the two SCOBYs. The A. esculenta SCOBY showed slightly rarer species of fungi and the species abundance of fungi was greater than that of S. latissima SCOBY. Furthermore, the number of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in A. esculenta SCOBY was higher than that in S. latissima SCOBY. This study shows the potential of using brown seaweed species as a fermentation substrate to develop a novel, fermented beverage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Consumption of nutrient-rich seaweeds and fermented nondairy foods represent fast growing trends among health-minded consumers. Assessment of lacto-fermented seaweed was performed to address these trends, and to offer shelf-life extension and product diversification for fresh kelps. The objectives were to evaluate the effects of kelp species and inclusion level on fermentation kinetics, physicochemical quality, safety, shelf-life, and consumer acceptability of a seaweed sauerkraut-style product. Six formulations with different inclusion levels (25, 50, and 75%) of shredded kelp (sugar kelp, SK or winged kelp, WK) were mixed with cabbage, 2% salt, and inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum (approximately 106 CFU/g) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (approximately 101 CFU/g). Products were processed in triplicate, fermented until a target pH of ≤4.6 was achieved, and sampled periodically for 60 days. Kelp species and inclusion level significantly affected most variables tested. The most rapid fermentation (3 days), as evidenced by pH decrease, lactic acid bacteria counts, and lactic acid levels, was noted in WK formulations. Some SK formulations took up to 14 days to achieve the target pH, and coliforms persisted to a greater extent in the SK formulations. Higher levels of kelp decreased the fermentation rate and concentration of fermentable sugars in the brine, but increased the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the sauerkrauts. Despite differences in instrumental color (L*a*b*) and texture (shear force) among formulations, overall liking as rated by a consumer panel was not significantly affected by species or inclusion level. Results support the use of lacto-fermentation in the production of refrigeration-stable seaweed sauerkraut-style product. Practical Application: Health-conscious consumers are becoming increasingly interested in plant-based diets and fermented foods, and the development of novel seaweed sauerkraut-style products can help to meet these needs. This study demonstrated the successful production of a sauerkraut-style product formulated with up to 50% farm-raised kelp. Physical, chemical, microbiological, and consumer acceptability testing established lactic acid fermentation as a viable method for shelf life extension and value addition of fresh kelps. These results provide science-based information on an alternative processing method for cultivated seaweeds and can assist the industry in product diversification efforts. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists®

AB  -                              Enzymatic depolymerization of seaweed polysaccharides is gaining interest for the production of functional oligosaccharides and fermentable sugars. We describe a thermostable alginate lyase belonging to Polysaccharide Lyase family 7 (PL7), which can be used to degrade brown seaweed, Saccharina latissima, at conditions also suitable for a commercial cellulase cocktail (Cellic CTec2). This enzyme, AMOR-PL7A, is a β-d-mannuronate specific (EC 4.2.2.3) endoacting alginate lyase, which degrades alginate and poly mannuronate within a broad range of pH, temperature and salinity. At 65 °C and pH 6.0, its Km and k                             cat                              values for sodium alginate are 0.51 ± 0.09 mg/mL and 7.8 ± 0.3 s                             -1                              respectively. Degradation of seaweed with blends of Cellic CTec2 and AMOR-PL7A at 55 °C in seawater showed that the lyase efficiently reduces viscosity and increases glucose solublization. Thus, AMOR-PL7A may be useful in development of efficient protocols for enzymatic seaweed processing.                          © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Holobionts have a digestive microbiota with catabolic abilities allowing the degradation of complex dietary compounds for the host. In terrestrial herbivores, the digestive microbiota is known to degrade complex polysaccharides from land plants while in marine herbivores, the digestive microbiota is poorly characterized. Most of the latter are generalists and consume red, green, and brown macroalgae, three distinct lineages characterized by a specific composition in complex polysaccharides, which represent half of their biomass. Subsequently, each macroalga features a specific epiphytic microbiota, and the digestive microbiota of marine herbivores is expected to vary with a monospecific algal diet. We investigated the effect of four monospecific diets (Palmaria palmata, Ulva lactuca, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) on the composition and specificity of the digestive microbiota of a generalist marine herbivore, the abalone, farmed in a temperate coastal area over a year. The microbiota from the abalone digestive gland was sampled every 2 months and explored using metabarcoding. RESULTS: Diversity and multivariate analyses showed that patterns of the microbiota were significantly linked to seasonal variations of contextual parameters but not directly to a specific algal diet. Three core genera: Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio constantly dominated the microbiota in the abalone digestive gland. Additionally, a less abundant and diet-specific core microbiota featured genera representing aerobic primary degraders of algal polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the establishment of a persistent core microbiota in the digestive gland of the abalone since its juvenile state and the presence of a less abundant and diet-specific core community. While composed of different microbial taxa compared to terrestrial herbivores, the digestive gland constitutes a particular niche in the abalone holobiont, where bacteria (i) may cooperate to degrade algal polysaccharides to products assimilable by the host or (ii) may have acquired these functions through gene transfer from the aerobic algal microbiota.

AB  - Kelps are colonized by a wide range of microbial symbionts. Among them, endophytic fungi remain poorly studied, but recent studies evidenced yet their high diversity and their central role in algal defense against various pathogens. Thus, studying the metabolic expressions of kelp endophytes under different conditions is important to have a better understanding of their impacts on host performance. In this context, fatty acid composition is essential to a given algae fitness and of interest to food web studies either to measure its nutritional quality or to infer about its contribution to consumers diets. In the present study, Paradendryphiella salina, a fungal endophyte was isolated from Saccharina latissima (L.) and Laminaria digitata (Hudson.) and its fatty acid composition was assessed at increasing salinity and temperature conditions. Results showed that fungal composition in terms of fatty acids displayed algal-dependent trajectories in response to temperature increase. This highlights that C18 unsaturated fatty acids are key components in the host-dependant acclimation of P. salina to salinity and temperature changes. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Brown macroalgae are an important source of polysaccharides, mainly fucose-containing sulphated polysaccharides (FCSPs), associated with several biological activities. However, the structural diversity and structure–function relationships for their bioactivities are still undisclosed. Thus, the aim of this work was to characterize the chemical structure of water-soluble Saccharina latissima polysaccharides and evaluate their immunostimulatory and hypocholesterolemic activities, helping to pinpoint a structure–activity relationship. Alginate, laminarans (F1, neutral glucose-rich polysaccharides), and two fractions (F2 and F3) of FCSPs (negatively charged) were studied. Whereas F2 is rich in uronic acids (45 mol%) and fucose (29 mol%), F3 is rich in fucose (59 mol%) and galactose (21 mol%). These two fractions of FCSPs showed immunostimulatory activity on B lymphocytes, which could be associated with the presence of sulphate groups. Only F2 exhibited a significant effect in reductions in in vitro cholesterol’s bioaccessibility attributed to the sequestration of bile salts. Therefore, S. latissima FCSPs were shown to have potential as immunostimulatory and hypocholesterolemic functional ingredients, where their content in uronic acids and sulphation seem to be relevant for the bioactive and healthy properties. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Kiloniella laminariae is a true marine bacterium and the first member of the family and order, the Kiloniellaceae and Kiloniellales. K. laminariae LD81T (= DSM 19542T) was isolated from the marine macroalga Saccharina latissima and is a mesophilic, typical marine chemoheterotrophic aerobic bacterium with antifungal activity. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed the similarity of K. laminariae LD81T not only with three validly described species of the genus Kiloniella, but also with undescribed isolates and clone sequences from marine samples in the range of 93.6–96.7%. We report on the analysis of the draft genome of this alphaproteobacterium and describe some selected features. The 4.4 Mb genome has a G + C content of 51.4%, contains 4213 coding sequences including 51 RNA genes as well as 4162 protein-coding genes, and is a part of the Genomic Encyclopaedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) project. The genome provides insights into a number of metabolic properties, such as carbon and sulfur metabolism, and indicates the potential for denitrification and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Comparative genome analysis was performed with K. laminariae LD81T and the animal-associated species Kiloniella majae M56.1T from a spider crab, Kiloniella spongiae MEBiC09566T from a sponge as well as Kiloniella litopenai P1-1 from a white shrimp, which all inhabit quite different marine habitats. The analysis revealed that the K. laminariae LD81T contains 1397 unique genes, more than twice the amount of the other species. Unique among others is a mixed PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster with similarity to the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of syringomycin. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The edible brown seaweed sugar Kombu (Saccharina latissima) is a good source of dietary fiber (DF) and associated compounds. Besides it presents antioxidant capacity in vitro due to their sulfated polysaccharides and polyphenols. The effect of a DF-rich sugar Kombu diet on biochemical parameters and antioxidant and prebiotic effects in healthy rats was evaluated. Thus, rats were fed either a basal diet or a supplemented one with 10 % sugar Kombu for 4 weeks. Several health-promoting effects were found such as a decrease in triglycerides (TGL) and uric acid (UrA), and an increase in antioxidant status both in serum and cecum. Regarding prebiotic effect, higher cecum weight and total short chain fatty acid (SCFA) content were evidenced in the seaweed-fed group, without significant differences on total bacterial count of feces. Sugar Kombu and sulfated polysaccharides from its DF could be used as functional ingredients for further nutraceutical applications. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The American seaweed industry is growing, primarily into the edible sector, and more seaweed products are available for human consumption. It is necessary to evaluate the safety of industry’s current post-harvest storage and processing methods to ensure the risk of foodborne pathogens on edible seaweed remains low. We evaluated the pathogen load of edible kelp post-harvest under three different storage temperatures (4˚C, 10˚C, 20˚C) and two different drying methods (air- and freeze-drying). The focal pathogens for this research included: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. We tested all six pathogens under each treatment condition on both sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) and rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) as these are the most commonly farmed and wild-harvested species in Maine, respectively. We inoculated a known concentration of pathogen onto freshly harvested kelp, treated it under a storage temperature or drying method, and sampled it over time to determine the impact of treatment on pathogen load. Our results showed that storage at 20˚C can lead to replication while storage at 4˚C and 10˚C halted the replication of focal pathogens. Both air-drying and freeze-drying produced significant log scale reductions in surface pathogen load for all focal pathogens. Additionally, air-drying reduced pathogen load more than freeze-drying for a majority of pathogens and storing dried kelp for 6-weeks further reduced pathogen load across all cases. These results are promising for industry as they corroborate historical evidence that current post-harvest storage and processing conditions are producing products safe for human consumption. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Saccharina latissima is a canopy-forming species of brown algae and, as such, is considered an ecosystem engineer. Several populations of this alga are exploited worldwide, and a decrease in the abundance of S. latissima at its southern distributional range limits has been observed. Despite its economic and ecological interest, only a few data are available on the composition of microbiota associated with S. latissima and its role in algal physiologyn. Methods: We studied the whole bacterial community composition associated with S. latissima samples from three locations (Brittany, Helgoland, and Skagerrak) by 16S metabarcoding analyses at different scales: algal blade part, regions, season (at one site), and algal physiologic state. Results and Discussion: We have shown that the difference in bacterial composition is driven by factors of decreasing importance: (i) the algal tissues (apex/meristem), (ii) the geographical area, (iii) the seasons (at the Roscoff site), and (iv) the algal host’s condition (healthy vs. symptoms). Overall, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia dominated the general bacterial communities. Almost all individuals hosted bacteria of the genus Granulosicoccus, accounting for 12% of the total sequences, and eight additional core genera were identified. Our results also highlight a microbial signature characteristic for algae in poor health independent of the disease symptoms. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the S. latissima microbiome, forming a basis for understanding holobiont functioning.

AB  - Saccharina latissima is a brown seaweed that could be used in ruminant feeding, but its fast deteriorating and seasonal growth nature limit their utilisation in the practice. Ensiling could be used as a preservation method, but information of its effects on the nutritional value of the seaweed is limited. This study evaluated the in vitro ruminal fermentation of different S. latissima silages using ruminal inoculum either from goats fed a mixed diet (60:40 oat hay:concentrate) or from sheep fed a high-forage diet (90:10 alfalfa hay:concentrate) to simulate different small ruminant production systems. S. latissima was ensiled in vacuum bags without additives (Control), with formic acid (4 g/kg seaweed; FA), with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) or with LAB after a pre-wilting treatment to reach a seaweed dry matter (DM) content of 30% (30LAB). Ensiling S. latissima decreased (p < 0.05) the content in DM, neutral detergent fibre and total extractable polyphenols, but nitrogen and fat content were unaffected. For both ruminal inoculums, ensiling decreased (p < 0.05) the asymptotic gas production after 120 h of fermentation (excepting for FA silage with goats’ inoculum), but the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production was unaffected. The VFA profile shifted towards greater (p < 0.05) acetate and lower (p < 0.05) propionate proportions in all silages compared with the pre-ensiling S. latissima. When goats inoculum was used, greater (p < 0.05) CH4 production compared with pre-ensiling S. latissima was observed in all silages, except Control one, which led to greater (p < 0.05) CH4/total VFA ratio. In contrast, no differences among samples (p > 0.05) in either CH4 production or CH4/total VFA ratio were observed when sheep’ inoculum was used. Fermentation of all samples started earlier with goats’ inoculum than with sheep’ inoculum, which was attributed to the different diet fed to the animals. These results suggest that ensiling S. latissima with either formic acid or lactic acid bacteria could be a viable conservation method to preserve the nutritive value. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Nowadays, the exponential expansion in human population has resulted in the massification of intensive agricultural practices, with crop yield and sustainability being one of the most pressing challenges. Therefore, there was a need for new and natural fertilizers and pesticides, which has become a popular agricultural trend nowadays. Therefore, there was an increased interest to apply seaweed and bacterial extracts in agriculture to promote new means of sustainability and soil usage. This work aims to test seaweed inclusion in the agricultural field, as a simple or complex foliar biofertilizer solution applied together with a nitrifying bacteria, to verify if there is a potential synergistic effect of these two different types of biofertilizers on economically important vegetables. As a result, experiments were conducted in a greenhouse using an aqueous extract of the brown seaweed Saccharina latissima (1.2% v/v) and a biofertilizer based on BlueN bacteria (0.03% m/v), both simple or in combination, on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa) plants. The seaweed extract (simple or in combination), presented favorable effect on lettuce growth and nutritional properties. The aqueous algal extract, and it in combination with BlueN, produced heavier lettuce leaves (74.25 ± 6.86 and 74.13 ± 3.07 g, respectively) than the controls and enriched leaf micronutrient contents (zinc and manganese). Also, this study demonstrated that a combined seaweed-bacteria fertilizer did not show synergistic behavior, being a non-profitable solution when compared to a simple seaweed extract. In summary, this study demonstrated that simple (crude) seaweed extracts can be considered as an important key for natural plant biofertilizers and growth stimulators concerned with the blue circular economy. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Bacteria in the genus Vibrio can be opportunistic pathogens for organisms in marine and estuarine systems. Consumption of seagrass by the blue crab Callinectes sapidus or macroalgal kelp by the lobster Homarus Americanus reduced epibiotic bacteria in the Vibrio genus. Bacterial Vibrio spp. densities were estimated by colony growth on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose agar. Nonspecific epibiotic bacterial densities were estimated by colony growth on nonselective agar or by direct counting under a fluorescence microscope. Consumption of the seagrass Ruppia maritima, but not the aquatic plant Stukenia pectinata or a control diet, reduced Vibrio spp. densities on blue crabs. A diet containing the kelp Saccharina latissima reduced Vibrio spp. densities on lobsters compared with a control diet. Results for nonspecific bacterial densities were mixed. A reduction was observed when cultured colonies were counted but not when cells were counted directly. The results suggest that diets containing seagrass or kelp can reduce epibiotic bacterial densities of some but not all bacterial species. This reduction may involve the utilization of antibacterial compounds obtained through diet and could enhance animal health by inhibiting growth of potential pathogens. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association.

AB  - This study is the first to evaluate the effects of five seaweeds (Ulva sp., Laminaria ochroleuca, Saccharina latissima, Gigartina sp., and Gracilaria vermiculophylla) on gas and methane production and ruminal fermentation parameters when incubated in vitro with two substrates (meadow hay and corn silage) for 24 h. Seaweeds led to lower gas production, with Gigartina sp. presenting the lowest value. When incubated with meadow hay, Ulva sp., Gigartina sp. and G. vermiculophylla decreased methane production, but with corn silage, methane production was only decreased by G. vermiculophylla. With meadow hay, L. ochroleuca and S. latissima promoted similar methane production as the control, but with corn silage, L. ochroleuca increased it. With the exception of S. latissima, all seaweeds promoted similar levels of total volatile fatty acid production. The highest proportion of acetic acid was produced with Ulva sp., G. vermiculophylla, and S. latissima; the highest proportion of butyric acid with the control and L. ochroleuca; and the highest proportion of iso-valeric acid with Gigartina sp. These results reveal the potential of seaweeds to mitigate ruminal methane production and the importance of the basal diet. To efficiently use seaweeds as feed ingredients with nutritional and environmental benefits, more research is required to determine the mechanisms underlying seaweed and substrate interactions. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The holdfast of Saccharina japonica (SjH) is a by-product of kombu cultivation and is rich in dietary fibres and phenolic compounds. SjH is regarded as a functional food material with anti-infection, immunomodulatory, and anti-viral effects. In this study, we aimed to examine SjH-responsive indigenous gut bacteria (SjH-RIB) in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice fed a diet containing either no fibre or 5% (w w−1) SjH for 14 days. Additionally, we sought to determine the effects of SjH on organic acids, putrefactive compounds, and microbiota in human faecal cultures. Human stool samples collected from five healthy volunteers were incubated without (control) or with 2% (w w−1) SjH at 37 °C for 24 h. The microbiota in murine caecal samples and human faecal cultures were analysed via 16S rRNA (V4) amplicon sequencing. Compared to the mice fed no-fibre diets, mice fed SjH showed high caecal levels of Clostridium sensu stricto 1-, Oscillospiraceae spp.-, Parabacteroides spp.-, and Alistipes spp.-like bacteria. In contrast, Allobaculum, a dominant genus in the no-fibre group, was not detected in the SjH group. In human faecal cultures, the levels of acetate and propionate were higher in SjH-cultures than in the control cultures (p < 0.05). Furthermore, SjH-cultures showed low phenol contents. The genera Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Bifidobacterium were more abundant in SjH-cultures than in the control cultures, although the abundance of each amplicon sequence variant in the SjH-RIB genera varied among individuals. These results suggest that the functions of SjH might be correlated with altered gut microbiota composition.

AB  - Seaweeds contain a myriad of nutrients and bioactives including proteins, carbohydrates and to a lesser extent lipids as well as small molecules including peptides, saponins, alkaloids and pigments. The bioactive bromoform found in the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis has been identified as an agent that can reduce enteric CH4 production from livestock significantly. However, sustainable supply of this seaweed is a problem and there are some concerns over its sustainable production and potential negative environmental impacts on the ozone layer and the health impacts of bromoform. This review collates information on seaweeds and seaweed bioactives and the documented impact on CH4 emissions in vitro and in vivo as well as associated environmental, economic and health impacts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to evaluate the protein value of products from the two seaweeds Saccharina latissima and Palmaria palmata grown in Norwegian waters and to characterize possible beneficial or detrimental effects in the intestine and other organs. Mink, a well-established model for comparison of nutrient digestibility in monogastric animals was used. Two products from each of the seaweeds, a dried whole biomass and a protein concentrate, were evaluated. Five diets were made; a reference diet based on fish meal, and one for each of the four seaweed products. In the latter four, seaweed supplied 200 g/kg of crude protein. Each diet was fed to four male mink for two weeks. The results showed that diets with seaweed were less palatable than the fish meal diet. The animals fed the whole Saccharina diet had a significantly higher water intake and urine production than the other animals, supposedly due to the very high ash content of this seaweed product. This diet also stood out regarding urine concentration of iodine, which was 300 times higher than for the fishmeal-based diet. Apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) for total amino acids, estimated by difference, showed low values for all the seaweed products; 0.574 and 0.734 for the whole and protein concentrated Saccharina products, and 0.588 and 0.700 for the two Palmaria products, respectively. The apparent amino acid digestibility coefficients (ADC) showed greater variation and were particularly low for histidine, <0.000 and 0.271 for the whole Saccharina and Palmaria products, respectively. Also, the ADC of methionine was low for these products, and cysteine ADC showed negative values for both Saccharina products. The estimated chemical score of the proteins, based on the digestible amino acids profile, was 0 and 520 g/kg for the whole product and protein concentrate of Saccharina, 260 and 520 g/kg for the whole product and the protein concentrate of Palmaria palmata, respectively. Expression of genes associated with digestive and immune functions showed minor effects in the jejunum, somewhat more pronounced effects in the colon. The latter effects were related to immune functions and lipid metabolism. No diet-related alterations in the histology of the jejunum and colon were observed. The histological investigation of liver and kidney structure showed some alterations in the seaweed fed animals. Regarding microbiota assemblage in mucosa of jejunum and colon, no clear diet effects were observed either in richness or diversity. In conclusion: the biological value of the seaweed proteins was low. Only one of the products, the Palmaria protein concentrate, might be considered of any use as a protein source. No clear beneficial or detrimental effects of the seaweed products were observed on gut health and function. The results regarding kidney structure and function, as well as the high iodine in the urine, indicating that further investigations are required to secure that animal health is not challenged by use of these seaweed ingredients in animal diets. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Monogeneans, a class of parasitic platyhelminthes, are usually found on the surface of fish. When it feeds on its host, it harbours bacteria, which can survive in its gut. Occasionally, the monogeneans may cause damages on fish tissue while feeding and may allow secondary infection. The present study aimed to isolate and identify culturable bacteria obtained within the gill monogeneans, Cichlidogyrus thurstonae and Scutogyrus longicornis, and gill surface of the tilapia fish, Oreochromis sp. based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Monogeneans were isolated from the fish gill filaments and surface disinfected using 70% ethanol before squashed aseptically on Luria Bertani (LB) agar to isolate the internal microbiota. A total of five bacteria species, namely Burkholderia sp., Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter sp., Ochrobactrum intermedium and Pantoea sp., were found within C. thurstonae, whilst a total of eight bacteria species, namely Burkholderia contaminans, Pantoea dispersa, Sphingomonas yabuuchiae, Rhizobium pusense, O. intermedium, Acinetobacter bereziniae, Escherichia hermannii, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, were found within S. longicornis in which B. contaminans, P. dispersa, and S. yabuuchiae were also found on the surface of the tilapia fish gill filaments. Enterobacter bugandensis and Acinetobacter pittii were found solely on the surface of the gill filaments. These bacteria are also found in the environment and some of them are believed to be pathogenic to fish. We suggest that monogeneans may serve as potential bacteria reservoirs, which facilitate the transmission of bacteria. © 2022 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fermentation is an ancient technique for preserving food and feed, and for moderating taste and texture of foods. Fermentation of seaweeds for generating novel food products has yet only been described for few red algae. Here, sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) was heat-treated and fermented using lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Taste, smell and texture of the fermented product was compared to fresh sugar kelp and two commercial seaweed products (nori and wakame). Tissue contents of dry matter, nitrogen, mannitol, and selected minerals and trace metals of the fresh and fermented sugar kelp were quantified and compared. In the fermentation process, the pH was reduced to 4.5 within 40 h, with LAB counts increasing 100-fold and no Bacillus cereus present. Heat-treatment and fermentation caused a reduced saltiness and umami flavour of the sugar kelp, a less slimy visual appearance and a reduced smell of sea, whereas the texture and protein content was unchanged compared to the fresh sugar kelp. The fermented sugar kelp had a stronger bite than nori and wakame, a stronger smell of sea and a more salty, irony and umami rich taste than nori, but less umami and salt taste than wakame. The fermentation process reduced the contents of sodium (− 15%), cadmium (− 35%) and mercury (− 37%) in the sugar kelp. LAB fermentation of sugar kelp showed promising for broadening the food market for seaweeds as the fermented product had a milder taste, improved visual impression and smell, and a reduced content of harmful trace metals. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - To understand the beneficial properties of edible algae obtained from the north-eastern (Sanriku) Satoumi region of Japan, the antioxidant properties of hot aqueous extract solutions (AES) obtained from 18 dried algal products were determined. The samples included 4 Ceratophyllum demersum (matsumo), 5 Undaria pinnatifida (wakame), 5 Laminaria japonica (kombu), and 2 each of Gloiopeltis furcate (funori) and G. tenax (funori). Of these products, the total phenolic content and Fe-reducing power were highest in matsumo. On the other hand, the polysaccharide content, viscosity, and superoxide anion radical (O2-)-scavenging capacity were highest in funori. Lactobacillus plantarum S-SU3, isolated from the intestine of Japanese surfperch, and Lb. plantarum S-SU1, isolated from salted squid, could ferment the AES of matsumo and funori, respectively. Although the Fe-reducing power of the matsumo solution was reduced due to fermentation, the O2--scavenging capacity of the funori solution was increased by fermentation. Furthermore, the fermented funori suspension protected Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a live cell model, against H2O2 toxicity. These results suggest that the fermented funori is a promising functional food material that is capable of protecting against reactive oxygen species. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Within Europe over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in seaweeds cultivated for human consumption. For food safety reasons, it is important to assess the microbiological and nutritional quality of the biomass. The fresh and dried edible seaweeds Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima were assessed over two consecutive years for the presence of microorganisms. Seaweed samples supplied from Scotland were stored under isothermal conditions for specific time intervals depending on the sample’s condition (fresh, dried or rehydrated). During storage, microbiological analyses were performed for the enumeration of Total Viable Counts (TVC), Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp., as well as yeasts and molds. Additionally, bacterial colonies from the Marine Agar growth medium were isolated and subjected to PCR-RAPD analysis for characterization of the bacterial diversity of seaweeds. Bacterial isolates with different fingerprint patterns were further subjected to sequencing (16S rDNA, V1–V4 region). The presence of human pathogenic bacteria was also investigated. Results showed that the initial population of TVC was differentiated depending on the year of seaweed harvest, being closer to the enumeration limit (1.0 log CFU/g) in fresh samples from 2020 and higher in samples from 2019 (6.7 and 3.9 log CFU/g in A. esculenta and S. latissima, respectively). DNA-based analysis revealed the presence of Psychrobacter, Cobetia and Pseudomonas species in A. esculenta, while Psychrobacter and Micrococcus species were present in S. latissima. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to discuss the chemical composition of three seaweed species commonly found in Nordic countries and its potential use in feed rations for pigs and calves. Two brown seaweeds Ascophyllum nodosum, Saccharina lastissima and a green seaweed Ulva sp. harvested from Danish and Icelandic waters were analyzed for proximate, amino acids, minerals, fatty acids and non-starch polysaccharides composition. All studied seaweeds contained low protein concentrations (i.e. 11.4–15.9 g/100 g DM). The ratio of essential amino acids (EAA) to non-essential amino acids (NEAA) was similar in all studied seaweeds (0.81−0.87). Ulva sp. had the highest ash concentration (48.2–54.4 g/100 g DM), followed by S. latissima (39.9 g/100 g DM) and A. nodosum (29.5 g/100 g DM). The most abundant macrominerals in the seaweeds were Ca, K and Na. Iodine was the most abundant micromineral in brown seaweeds (1.4–2.1 g/kg DM). Moreover, Ulva sp. had the highest Fe (5.1–8.0 g/kg DM), Mn (10.5 g/kg DM) and inorganic As (0.008 g/kg DM) concentrations. Ascophyllum nodosum had the highest crude fat concentration (3 g/100 g DM) and the highest concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) (37.9 g/100 g FA). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentration was the highest in A. nodosum (7 g/100 g FA) followed by S. latissima (5 g/100 g FA) and Ulva sp. (2 g/100 g FA). Furthermore, concentration of α-linolenic acid, a precursor for EPA, was the highest in Ulva sp. (6.2–14.6 g/100 g FA). Total dietary fiber concentration was higher in the brown seaweeds (27.8–42.6 g/100 g DM) compared to the green seaweeds (17.9–21.5 g/100 g DM), where S. latissima had the highest soluble dietary fiber concentration. The high concentrations of ash and fiber may limit inclusion levels of the analyzed whole seaweeds in feed rations, mainly due to dilution of other nutrients in the feed, reduced digestibility of the feed and possible toxicities (i.e. high inorganic As). On the other hand, high concentrations of essential and valuable microminerals including I, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se were also detected in the studied seaweeds. High soluble dietary fiber concentration in S. latissima can be of interest as a fermentable substrate for probiotic bacteria. The easily digestible nutrients including, crude protein and fat were low in the seaweeds. However, the protein, fat, ash and dietary fiber fractions of the studied seaweeds were characterized by high concentrations of EAA, EFA, essential microminerals and interesting monomers of functional polysaccharides, respectively; which indicate possibilities for future use of seaweed-extracts in feed rations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the intrinsic biodegradation potential of marine organic sediment for effective biogas production from various species of marine macroalgae and non-marine biomass. Biogas production potential tests were carried out on three species of seaweed harvested from the west coasts of Scotland, Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus, and Saccharina latissima, and on a non-marine cellulose biomass seeded with uncultivated and unadapted anoxic marine sediments. As a comparison, the same experiments were repeated using the same substrates but seeded with active mesophilic anaerobically digested sewage sludge. For the cultures seeded with anoxic marine sediments, the highest methane yield was observed in both L. digitata and S. latissima cultures while F. serratus and cellulose, cultures performed relatively poorly. For those seeded with digested sludge, all cultures performed relatively well, except F. serratus. These results show that marine sediments can be effective inoculum for seaweeds digestion. Phylogenetic analyses of the methanogenic community in both sources of inoculum showed that the methanogen community within the sediment and sludge seeded cultures were different. Each culture was dominated by methanogenic populations suitable for the utilisation of the specific biomass derivatives and environmental conditions. For instance, members of the genus Methanosaeta which, dominated sludge seeded cultures were not detected in the sediment seeded cultures. A similar occurrence was observed for the genus Methanofollis which was only detected in the sediment seeded cultures. Hence, in areas where seaweed forms part of a co-digestion with non-marine biomass, start-up using a mixture of anoxic marine sediments and digested wastewater sludge has the potential to provide greater process stability and robustness than using either as sole inoculum. © 2020

AB  - The Kiloniellaceae family is represented currently by a single genus Kiloniella with the species Kiloniella laminariae as type species. Kiloniella laminariae was isolated from the marine macroalga Saccharina latissima (former Laminaria saccharina) obtained from the Baltic Sea. The bacterium is a mesophilic, typical marine bacterium. It is a chemoheterotrophic aerobic bacterium with the potential of denitrification. Growth optima are at 25 °C, pH 5.5, and 3 % NaCl. The distinguished phylogenetic position separates Kiloniella from other alphaproteobacterial orders. The 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed a distant relationship to species of several orders of the Alphaproteobacteria with less than 91 % sequence similarity. This gives rise to the recognition of Kiloniella as a representative of a new order of the Alphaproteobacteria, the Kiloniellales. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a distinct cluster of Kiloniella with an uncharacterized bacterium (isolate KOPRI 13522) from hydrothermal plumes. This cluster forms a larger group together with the distantly related Terasakiella pusilla (88.4 % sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene) and the Thalassospira species (88.9-90.2 % sequence similarity). These genera are supposed to form separate families within the Kiloniellales. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alexandrium catenella is a harmful algal bloom (HAB)-forming dinoflagellate that causes significant damage to the cultivation and harvest of shellfish due to its synthesis of paralytic shellfish toxins. To evaluate the potential for macroalgae aquaculture to mitigate A. catenella blooms, we determined the effects of three cultivable macroalgae - Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), Chondrus crispus (Irish moss), and Ulva spp. - on A. catenella in culture- and field-based experiments. Co-culture growth assays of A. catenella exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of each macroalgae showed that all species except low levels of C. crispus caused cell lysis and significant reductions in A. catenella densities relative to control treatments of 17–74% in 2–3 days and 42–96% in ~one week (p<0.05 for all assays). In a toxin accumulation experiment, S. latissima significantly lessened (p<0.05) saxitoxin (STX) accumulation in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), keeping levels (71.80±1.98 µg STX 100 g−1) below US closure limits (80 µg STX 100 g−1) compared to the untreated control (93.47±8.11 µg STX 100 g−1). Bottle incubations of field-collected, bloom populations of A. catenella experienced significant reductions in cell densities of up to 95% when exposed to aquaculture concentrations of all three macroalgae (p<0.005 for all). The stocking of aquacultured S. latissima within mesocosms containing a bloom population of A. catenella (initial density: 3.2 × 104 cells L−1) reduced the population of A. catenella by 73% over 48 h (p<0.005) while Ulva addition caused a 54% reduction in A. catenella over 96 h (p<0.01). Among the three seaweeds, their ordered ability to inhibit A. catenella was S. latissima > Ulva spp. > C. crispus. Seaweeds’ primary anti-A. catenella activity were allelopathic, while nutrient competition, pH elevation, and macroalgae-attached bacteria may have played a contributory role in some experiments. Collectively, these results suggest that the integration of macroalgae with shellfish-centric aquaculture establishments should be considered as a non-invasive, environmentally friendly, and potentially profit-generating measure to mitigate A. catenella-caused damage to the shellfish aquaculture industry. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Seaweed is gaining attention as a sustainable source of protein. However, the nutritional protein quality needs further investigation to explore the potential of seaweed as a protein source. This study evaluates in vivo digestibility of six different seaweed protein products, four from Ulva sp. and two from Saccharina latissima. Ulva sp. was either preserved in a preservation liquid and spin flash-dried, freeze-dried without any pre-treatment or protein was extracted from the crude biomass with a screw press and isoelectrically precipitated (pH 2.5) with or without sulfite addition during extraction. Saccharina latissima was either freeze-dried or fermented with lactic acid bacteria prior to freeze-drying. The digestibility of the seaweed products was tested in a rat trial, where seaweed protein products constituted 50% of the nitrogen (N) in diets, the other 50% of N coming from whey protein concentrate. The protein concentration and proportion of essential amino acids (EAA) were increased upon protein extraction from Ulva sp. and the ash content was reduced. This led to an increased N digestibility of 55.5 ± 2.7% for the protein extract without sulfite, being 10–13%-points higher than for the other Ulva sp. products. The sulfite addition seemed to counteract the effect of extraction regarding the N digestibility. Fermentation of S. latissima increased the total amino acid content along with increased EAA proportion and lowered the ash content. However, the fermentation did not improve the organic matter, ash or N digestibility. Digestibility was in general low, but this study demonstrates the potential to increase seaweed N digestibility by more than 20% through protein extraction. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Macro- and microalgae are used in a variety of commercial products with many more in development. This chapter outlines the major products, species used, methods of production, extraction, and processing as well as market sizes and trends. Foods, nutraceuticals, and feeds are the major commercial products from algae. Well-known culinary products include Nori, Wakame, Kombu and Dulse, from whole macroalgal biomass. The microalgae Spirulina and Chlorella have been widely marketed as nutritional supplements for both humans and animals. Several microalgae with a high nutritional value and energy content are grown commercially as aquaculture feed. The major processed products from macroalgae are the hydrocolloids, including carrageenan, agars, and alginates, used as gelling agents in a variety of foods and healthcare products. Pigments extracted from algae include P-carotene, astaxanthin, and phycobiliproteins. These are generally used as food colorants, as additives in animal feed or as nutraceuticals for their antioxidant properties (Radmer in Bioscience 46:263-270, 1996; Pulz and Gross in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 65:635-648, 2004). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are another high value product derived from microalgae. Other potential products include fertilizers, fuels, cosmetics and chemicals. Algae also have application in bioremediation and CO2 sequestration, as well as producing many interesting bioactive compounds. Algae have great potential to produce a wide range of valuable compounds, beyond their current exploitation. To date, commercialization of new products has been slow (Milledge in Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology 10:31 -41, 2011; Wijffels in Trends in Biotechnology 26:26-31, 2007; Radmer in Bioscience 46:263-270, 1996; Pulz and Gross in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 65:635-648, 2004; Spolaore et al. in Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering 101(2):87-96, 2006), however, microalgal biotechnology is a relatively new industry, and therefore, it is unsurprising that significant challenges remain to be solved. The advantages associated with algal production are likely to ensure that efforts continue. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Objective: The substrate and fermentation conditions are critical for kombucha production. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of different substrates on kombucha fermentation. Material and Methods: Black and green tea samples (BT and GT) were cooled to 25°C and mixed with an equal amount of kombucha culture. Fermentation continued for 7 days at 25°C. The pH, chemical composition, sugar components, color properties, organic acid profiles, and sensory properties of kombucha (BTK and GTK) were evaluated. Results: During fermentation, pH slightly decreased in both tea samples; the ash content of kombucha samples decreased significantly compared to the first day of fermentation. During fermentation, the microbiota thoroughly utilized glucose, fructose, and sucrose in black tea kombucha samples. Although sugar is used during the fermentation of green tea, significant amounts of glucose, fructose, and sucrose were detected in green tea kombucha. In both samples, acetic acid increased significantly due to fermentation. Kombucha, produced with black and green tea, is generally consumed with pleasure. Conclusion: It is critical to investigate the properties of kombucha, which is a product that could be an alternative to tea consumption habits in our country and could improve its health properties by fermentation. © 2023 authors.

AB  - Probiotic fermentation was conducted on two species of edible Irish brown seaweeds, Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata as a sole source of nutrition for the bacteria. Seaweeds were heat treated followed by fermentation with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Kinetics of cell growth, acid production, and sugar consumption were examined. The effects of heating and fermentation on the changes in total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant activity were also monitored. Lactobacillus rhamnosus grew well on both the seaweed species and reached nearly 10 log cfu ml -1 after 16-24 h of fermentation; however, the specific growth rate was 1.5 times higher on S. latissima. Lactic acid was the major product of the fermentation, followed by acetic acid. Heat treatment resulted in a 50-64.4% reduction in TPC and TFC for both the seaweeds concomitant with a leaching of phytochemicals into the water used for heating. Subsequently, fermentation resulted in 28% and 37.6% increases in the TPC and 1.18- and 2.04-fold increases in TFC for S. latissima and Lam. digitata, respectively, with a simultaneous increase in the antioxidant activity as well. Changes in the TPC and TFC were represented by zero-, first-, or second-order kinetic models. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the seaweeds as well as the broth revealed the presence of polyphenolic signals at different ranges.

AB  - Background: The direct use of medical zinc oxide in feed will be abandoned after 2022 in Europe, leaving an urgent need for substitutes to prevent post-weaning disorders. Results: This study investigated the effect of using rapeseed-seaweed blend (rapeseed meal added two brown macroalgae species Ascophylum nodosum and Saccharina latissima) fermented by lactobacilli (FRS) as feed ingredients in piglet weaning. From d 28 of life to d 85, the piglets were fed one of three different feeding regimens (n = 230 each) with inclusion of 0%, 2.5% and 5% FRS. In this period, no significant difference of piglet performance was found among the three groups. From a subset of piglets (n = 10 from each treatment), blood samples for hematology, biochemistry and immunoglobulin analysis, colon digesta for microbiome analysis, and jejunum and colon tissues for histopathological analyses were collected. The piglets fed with 2.5% FRS manifested alleviated intraepithelial and stromal lymphocytes infiltration in the gut, enhanced colon mucosa barrier relative to the 0% FRS group. The colon microbiota composition was determined using V3 and V1-V8 region 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing by Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION, respectively. The two amplicon sequencing strategies showed high consistency between the detected bacteria. Both sequencing strategies indicated that inclusion of FRS reshaped the colon microbiome of weaned piglets with increased Shannon diversity. Prevotella stercorea was verified by both methods to be more abundant in the piglets supplied with FRS feed, and its abundance was positively correlated with colonic mucosa thickness but negatively correlated with blood concentrations of leucocytes and IgG. Conclusions: FRS supplementation relieved the gut lymphocyte infiltration of the weaned piglets, improved the colon mucosa barrier with altered microbiota composition. Increasing the dietary inclusion of FRS from 2.5% to 5% did not lead to further improvements. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The limitation on the prophylactic use of antibiotics in animal feed in Europe has critically challenged the rabbit meat industry, which urgently needs to find solutions. A feasible alternative could be using macroalgae in the diet to improve the gut health. This research studied seven species of marine macroalgae in four formats (dehydrated, enzymatically hydrolyzed, aqueous extract, and aqueous extract of hydrolyzed macroalgae) in order to select the most promising ones for their use in rabbit feed. Chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, in vitro caecal gas, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against common pathogens were studied. All S. latissima products showed high caecal fermentability and VFA production, especially in both types of extracts. The H. elongata aqueous extract was remarkable due to its high in vitro butyrate production, which can be of great interest for improving gut health. The MIC results did not indicate any clear inhibition of the pathogens tested. The macroalgae tested appear to have a potentially prebiotic effect, rather than a direct antimicrobial activity. However, these results must be confirmed in vivo, in order to observe the real benefits of feeding macroalgae during the rabbit weaning period. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Alginates are valued in many industries, due to their versatile properties. These polysaccharides originate from brown algae (Phaeophyceae) and some bacteria of the Azotobacter and Pseudomonas genera, consisting of 1 → 4 linked β-D-mannuronic acid (M), and its C5-epimer α-L-guluronic acid (G). Several applications rely on a high G-content, which confers good gelling properties. Because of its high natural G-content (FG = 0.60–0.75), the alginate from Laminaria hyperborea (LH) has sustained a thriving industry in Norway. Alginates from other sources can be upgraded with mannuronan C-5 epimerases that convert M to G, and this has been demonstrated in many studies, but not applied in the seaweed industry. The present study demonstrates epimerisation directly in the process of alginate extraction from cultivated Saccharina latissima (SL) and Alaria esculenta (AE), and the lamina of LH. Unlike conventional epimerisation, which comprises multiple steps, this in-process protocol can decrease the time and costs necessary for alginate upgrading. In-process epimerisation with AlgE1 enzyme enhanced G-content and hydrogel strength in all examined species, with the greatest effect on SL (FG from 0.44 to 0.76, hydrogel Young's modulus from 22 to 34 kPa). As proof of concept, an upscaled in-process epimerisation of alginate from fresh SL was successfully demonstrated. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This study aims to develop an analog fish product with comparable nutrients using plant-based materials such as oyster mushrooms, nori, and kombu and grade them on the 9-point hedonic scale for sensory characteristics such as appearance, aroma, juiciness, texture, and taste. Oyster mushrooms are high in protein and have an umami flavor amplified by adding seaweeds such as nori and kombu to give them a fishy flavor. The mushroom has a flaky texture that helps it resemble the fish's texture. We combined hydrated mushrooms and seaweeds with maize flour, baking powder, salt, and MSG to make the balls. The concentration of ingredients such as oyster mushroom, nori, kombu, baking powder, salt, and MSG was optimized using one-factor optimization. The final concentration of 6 % nori, 4 % kombu,24 % corn flour, 0.9 % baking powder, 1 % salt, 1 % MSG, and 63.1 % oyster mushroom using sensory data. Response surface methodology was also used to predict the appropriate model for the production of the fish analogs in which 8 % nori, 6 % kombu,23.981 % corn flour, 0.6 % baking powder, 0.81 % salt, 1.2 % MSG, and 59.4 % oyster mushroom using the D- optimal mixture design method. The sensory characteristics of vegan fish analogs were analyzed using the fuzzy scale (F1–F6), and samples were screened based on similarity values. The shelf life study was also carried out using an optimized formulation by treating with citric acid, adding preservatives like sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate, and in combination with potassium sorbate and citric acid. During the storage, antioxidant capacity, phytochemical analysis, rancidity study, moisture content, and microbial study were recorded. © 2023

AB  - Brown macroalgae, including the kelp Saccharina latissima, are of both ecological and increasing economic interest. Together with their microbiota, these organisms form a singular entity, the holobiont. Sampling campaigns are required to study the microbiome of algae in natural populations, but freezing samples in liquid nitrogen is complex in the field, particularly at remote locations. Here we tested two simple alternative methods for sampling the microbial diversity associated with the kelp S. latissima: silica gel conservation of tissue and swab samples preserved in DNA/RNA shield solution. We used these techniques to compare apex and meristem samples from Roscoff (Brittany, France) and evaluated their impact on the results of 16S rDNA metabarcoding experiments. Both methods were able to separate apex and meristem microbiomes, and the results were concordant with results obtained for flash-frozen samples. However, differences were observed for several rare genera and ASVs, and the detection of contaminant sequences in the silica gel-preserved samples underline the importance of including blank samples for this method. Globally, our results confirm that the silica gel technique and swabbing combined with DNA/RNA shield preservation are valid alternatives to liquid nitrogen preservation when sampling brown macroalgae in the field. However, they also underline that, regardless of the method, caution should be taken when interpreting data on rare sequences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) is an abundantly available macroalgae species along the Norwegian coast, and there is currently emerging an industry based on seaweed cultivation. In this study, the biomass growth of cultivated S. latissima deployed in February was studied at cultivation depths of 3 and 8 meters (m) and monitored over the period of May, June, and August. The highest biomass production was observed in June at the depth of 3 m (38.3 kg wet weight m−2). Furthermore, all seaweed samples underwent a detailed chemical characterization including analysis of carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, fucose, xylose, uronic acids), amino acids and minerals. The macroalgae deployed in February at 3 m depth and sampled in June had the highest proportion of total sugars (534.5 g kg−1 of DM) and the lowest content of ash (252.7 g kg−1 of DM). Thus, cultivation at 3 m and harvesting in June are suitable when the feedstock is used for biochemical production of fuels and chemicals. Macroalgae deployed at 8 m depth and harvested in August had the highest proportion of total amino acids (242.4 g kg−1 DM) and ash content (411.5 g kg−1 DM). This biomass may be suitable as a nitrogen and mineral source in microbial growth media. Overall, the choice of cultivation depth and harvesting time depends on the intended use of the seaweed biomass. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - "Counting calories becomes completely unnecessary when your food doesn't come with labels". In this busy world of junk food, the value of medicinal based products now has a greater impact to the society. Kombucha is an ancient medicinal beverage which is now one of the rising marketing products in the United States as a part of Global functional beverage. Kombucha (kombu-seaweed, cha- tea) is nothing but a fermented beverage (an ancient probiotic) consisting of black or green tea which is a substratum and by providing excessive sugar, it prompts a synergistic relationship between bacteria and yeast, later resulting in the formation of a zoogloeal mat. It was once considered as a controversial topic due to the side effects caused by consuming kombucha but now, it is weighed as a topic of research due to some hidden beneficial health effects. It has some water-soluble vitamins, antimicrobial supplements and few hydrolytic enzymes, plays a major role in the microbiome activation in human. It has a unique feature of killing ability i.e., by activation of bacteriocin which firstly lowers the toxicity then it gradually reduces the intracellular ATP production acting against Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The major drawback of kombucha is, it may revert the Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) property in hepatic toxicity. This article not only stresses on the proclaimed health effects of consuming kombucha but also on the mystical side that was kept hidden long for about 2000 years and to firmly reveal that it can also be considered as one of the suggested health drinks. © 2020 Plant Archives.

AB  - The sugar kelp Saccharina latissima dominates many temperate coastal ecosystems, plays key ecological roles and presents important economic potential. However, its microbiota remains poorly investigated, although it could play an important role in algal fitness. In this study, we combined high throughput Illumina-based DNA sequencing and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization to perform a culture-independent investigation of the S. latissima bacterial and fungal microbiota. Up to 600 bacterial and 100 fungal Amplicon Sequence Variants were identified per algal individual, revealing diverse bacterial and fungal communities associated to S. latissima. Overall, bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, in particular Hyphomonadaceae and Cyclobacteriaceae. Fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, in particular Mycosphaerellaceae, Psathyrellaceae, and Bulleribasidiaceae. Our results also revealed a variable distribution of S. latissima microbiota, as two adjacent tissue samples typically contained distinct fungal and bacterial assemblages, and CARD-FISH analysis detected microbial endosymbionts (with a few epibionts). Complementary analyses showed that despite achieving a good sequencing coverage for each tissue sample, the unexpected diversity and variability of ASVs made the definition of a core fungal and bacterial microbiota difficult, and highlights novel avenues to overcome the limitations of current surface-sterilization and metabarcoding protocols. © Copyright © 2020 Tourneroche, Lami, Burgaud, Domart-Coulon, Li, Gachon, Gèze, Boeuf and Prado.

AB  - Brown seaweeds have a rich bioactive content known to modulate biological processes, including the mucosal immune response and microbiota function, and may therefore have the potential to control enteric pathogens. Here, we tested if dietary seaweed (Saccharina latissima) supplementation could modulate pig gut health with a specific focus on parasitic helminth burdens, gut microbiota composition, and host immune response during a five week feeding period in pigs co-infected with the helminths Ascaris suum and Oesophagostomum dentatum. We found that inclusion of fermented S. latissima (Fer-SL) at 8% of the diet increased gut microbiota α-diversity with higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Verrucomicrobia, Spirochaetes and Elusimicrobia, and lower abundance of Prevotella copri. In the absence of helminth infection, transcription of immune-related genes in the intestine was only moderately influenced by dietary seaweed. However, Fer-SL modulated the transcriptional response to infection in a site-specific manner in the gut, with an attenuation of infection-induced gene expression in the jejunum and an amplification of gene expression in the colon. Effects on systemic immune parameters (e.g. blood lymphocyte populations) were limited, indicating the effects of Fer-SL were mainly localized to the intestinal tissues. Despite previously documented in vitro anti-parasitic activity against pig helminths, Fer-SL inclusion did not significantly affect parasite egg excretion or worm establishment. Collectively, our results show that although Fer-SL inclusion did not reduce parasite burdens, it may modify the gut environment during enteric parasite infection, which encourages continued investigations into the use of seaweeds or related products as novel tools to improve gut health. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The alginate industry processes more than hundred thousand tons per year of algae in Europe, discarding around 80% of the algae biomass as different solid/liquid residual streams. In this work, Saccharina latissima and Ascophyllum nodosum, their generated alginates and all residual fractions generated in the process were characterized in terms of lipid, ash, protein content, and the carbohydrate composition and antioxidant capacities analyzed. The first fraction after acid treatment (ca. 50% of the initial dry biomass) was rich in phlorotannins (15 mg GAE/g) and bioactive fucoidans (15–70%), with a high sulfation degree in A. nodosum. Two fractions generated from the solid residue, one soluble and another insoluble (Ra and Rb, respectively), constituted 9% and 5–8% of the initial biomass and showed great potential as a source of soluble protein (30% for S. latissima), and cellulose (70%) or fucoidan, respectively. Valorization strategies are suggested for these waste streams, evidencing their high potential as bioactive, texturizing or nutritional added-value ingredients for cosmetic, food, feed or pharmaceutical applications. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Fucoidans are complex bioactive sulfated fucosyl-polysaccharides primarily found in brown macroalgae. Endo-fucoidanases catalyze the specific hydrolysis of α-L-fucosyl linkages in fucoidans and can be utilized to tailor-make fucoidan oligosaccharides and elucidate new structural details of fucoidans. In this study, an endo-α(1,3)-fucoidanase encoding gene, Mef2, from the marine bacterium Muricauda eckloniae, was cloned, and the Mef2 protein was functionally characterized. Based on the primary sequence, Mef2 was suggested to belong to the glycosyl hydrolase family 107 (GH107) in the Carbohydrate Active enZyme database (CAZy). The Mef2 fucoidanase showed maximal activity at pH 8 and 35◦C, although it could tolerate temperatures up to 50◦C. Ca2+ was shown to increase the melting temperature from 38 to 44◦C and was furthermore required for optimal activity of Mef2. The substrate specificity of Mef2 was investigated, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the enzymatic activity (Units per µM enzyme: Uf/µM) of Mef2 on two structurally different fucoidans, showing an activity of 1.2 × 10−3 Uf/µM and 3.6 × 10−3 Uf/µM on fucoidans from Fucus evanescens and Saccharina latissima, respectively. Inter-estingly, Mef2 was identified as the first described fucoidanase active on fucoidans from S. latissima. The fucoidan oligosaccharides released by Mef2 consisted of a backbone of α(1,3)-linked fucosyl residues with unique and novel α(1,4)-linked fucosyl branches, not previously identified in fucoidans from S. latissima. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Kelp are important primary producers that are colonized by diverse microbes that can have both positive and negative effects on their hosts. The kelp microbiome could support the burgeoning kelp cultivation sector by improving host growth, stress tolerance, and resistance to disease. Fundamental questions about the cultivated kelp microbiome still need to be addressed before microbiome-based approaches can be developed. A critical knowledge gap is how cultivated kelp microbiomes change as hosts grow, particularly following outplanting to sites that vary in abiotic conditions and microbial source pools. In this study we assessed if microbes that colonize kelp in the nursery stage persist after outplanting. We characterized microbiome succession over time on two species of kelp, Alaria marginata and Saccharina latissima, outplanted to open ocean cultivation sites in multiple geographic locations. We tested for host-species specificity of the microbiome and the effect of different abiotic conditions and microbial source pools on kelp microbiome stability during the cultivation process. We found the microbiome of kelp in the nursery is distinct from that of outplanted kelp. Few bacteria persisted on kelp following outplanting. Instead, we identified significant microbiome differences correlated with host species and microbial source pools at each cultivation site. Microbiome variation related to sampling month also indicates that seasonality in host and/or abiotic factors may influence temporal succession and microbiome turnover in cultivated kelps. This study provides a baseline understanding of microbiome dynamics during kelp cultivation and highlights research needs for applying microbiome manipulation to kelp cultivation. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Seaweeds are generally harvested at certain seasons to obtain optimal yield and quality for specific purposes. Year-round biorefining of seaweed, therefore, requires storage of the biomass from harvest to processing. We investigated ensiling as a method for preserving seaweed biomass for subsequent biorefinery. In lab-scale and pilot-scale experiments of up to one-year duration, sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) biomass was preserved by either biological ensiling by means of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation or by chemical ensiling by addition of lactic acid to reduce pH. The results clearly demonstrated that the ensilability of sugar kelp was positively correlated with the glucose content of the biomass. The ensiling process could be optimized by application of molasses and further improved by addition of LAB inoculum. The doses of molasses and lactic acid were important for pH after biological and chemical ensiling, respectively. Biological ensiling reduced the content of glucose and increased the content of fermentation products. In conclusion, ensiling appears to be an interesting preservation method for seaweed biomass, which may be optimized by application of ensiling additives. However, ensiling also changes the chemical composition of the biomass, and the applicability of ensiling for preserving seaweed biomass may depend on the subsequent use of the silage in biorefinery processes. © 2020, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

AB  - Sugar kelp cultivation at the southern end of its range on the east coast of North America is being pursued commercially for human consumption, which demands a high-quality product. Blade quality can be compromised by attached organisms – epibionts. Biweekly examination of epibionts on sugar kelp was conducted April–May 2018, on a kelp farm in eastern Long Island Sound, CT, USA. Culturable Vibrio spp. were not present on kelp blades until May and were limited to only old sections. No Vibrio colonies were human pathogens V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus, based upon ToxR-specific multiplex PCR assays. Neither epibenthic cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. nor the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, microbes of concern because of toxigenicity, were detected on kelp by microscopy or metabarcoding of partial rRNA genes. The lacy bryozoan was the only epibiotic animal observed that could cause damage to kelp, but its abundance was low. Summarizing most-common sequence reads, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial group on kelp blades (49%) and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant in seawater (39%). Bacillariophyta were the most abundant eukaryotes on kelp blades (36%) and Dinoflagellata were the most abundant eukaryotes in seawater (43%). Molecular operational taxonomic unit matrices were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling; the most prominent structure for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities was the separation between blade and seawater samples. This spatial separation explained 81% and 76% of the variation among prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, respectively. Indicator Species Analysis identified Gammaproteobacteria (55%) and Bacillariophyta (56%) to be the most important blade indicator prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. A closer examination of indicator species temporal patterns and their ecophysiology suggested that Aquimarina, Parcubacteria, and Peronosporomycetes are potential pathogens to sugar kelp. Ciliates may be the most important grazers that keep epiphytes (Bacillariophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta) and Peronosporomycetes on kelp in check. © 2022

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that seaweed extracts can protect plants against microbial disease by upregulating the host’s immune system. However, if this upregulation comes at a cost to host vegetative and reproductive growth it will make the use of seaweed extracts in crop disease protection less attractive. In a series of experiments, using Arabidopsis thaliana infected by white rust (Albugo sp.) and treated with crude extracts of Ulva lactuca and Saccharina latissima, we test the hypothesis that a growth-immunity trade-off exists. We include temporal samples of the two seaweed species because the composition of bioactive molecules in them is known to vary over the year. Our results confirm that extracts of both species have the potential to protect against disease, but that both the timing of seaweed sampling and extraction procedures can introduce considerable variation to this effect. Importantly, these seaweed treatments were also associated with reduced host vegetative mass, though treatment with S. latissima could compensate for this as it also stimulated increased seed mass. We conclude that the effects of crude seaweed extracts from U. lactuca and S. latissima on plant fitness are not immediately predictable, and benefits in terms of disease protection may come with costs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Information on the contents of both vitamin B12 and folate in edible seaweeds is limited, of which deficiencies disrupt methionine biosynthesis to accumulate homocysteine as a risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Methods: Both vitamins were determined in commercially available edible seaweed products using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Dried purple laver (Neopyropia yezoensis) products contain higher levels of vitamin B12 (approximately 30-60 ug/100 g dry weight) and folate compounds (approximately 880-1300 ug/100 g dry weight) than other seaweed products, such as kombu (Saccharina japonica), hijiki (Sargassum fusiformis), and wakame (Undaria pinnatifida). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was the major folate compound in purple laver products. 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was found at a moderate level, whereas tetrahydrofolate, 5,10-metenyltetrahydrofolate, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and folic acid were found to be minor folate compounds. Conclusions: These findings suggest that dried purple laver (nori) products are suitable sources of vitamin B12 and folate compounds for humans, especially vegetarians. © 2023 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - In the Northeast USA, the aquaculture of macroalgae is a rapidly growing industry. Within this region, there are no established regulations for farm siting or methods of pathogen detection on macroalgae cultivated or harvested for human consumption. Bacterial pathogens from natural and anthropogenic sources may persist in coastal waters and can potentially contaminate macroalgae. During the winter growing season, sugar kelp Saccharina latissima and adjacent water were sampled from three sites of kelp aquaculture located in adjacent bays of ME, USA. Membrane filtration onto selective media detected Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus in kelp and water samples at all sites, however plate counts were very low. The foodborne pathogens Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, V. parahaemolyticus, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 were detected on enriched kelp samples from 83%, 78%, and 56% of sampling events, respectively, using molecular methods. Even with low bacterial levels, this frequency of detection confirms the risk of foodborne pathogens present on kelp and recommends the development of best management practices to control microbial growth during kelp harvest and processing. Bacterial plate counts from kelp samples often varied from those of water, indicating the importance of sampling the kelp directly, and that the association between bacterial pathogens on kelp and in the surrounding water should be further investigated. This study provides the first food safety assessment of sea vegetables in this region with the goal of providing data to enable the expansion of its industry. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The facultative methylotroph Bacillus methanolicus MGA3 has previously been genetically engineered to overproduce the amino acids L-lysine and L-glutamate and their derivatives cadaverine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from methanol at 50°C. We here explored the potential of utilizing the sugar alcohol mannitol and seaweed extract (SWE) containing mannitol, as alternative feedstocks for production of chemicals by fermentation using B. methanolicus. Extracts of the brown algae Saccharina latissima harvested in the Trondheim Fjord in Norway were prepared and found to contain 12–13 g/l of mannitol, with conductivities corresponding to a salt content of ∼2% NaCl. Initially, 12 B. methanolicus wild type strains were tested for tolerance to various SWE concentrations, and some strains including MGA3 could grow on 50% SWE medium. Non-methylotrophic and methylotrophic growth of B. methanolicus rely on differences in regulation of metabolic pathways, and we compared production titers of GABA and cadaverine under such growth conditions. Shake flask experiments showed that recombinant MGA3 strains could produce similar and higher titers of cadaverine during growth on 50% SWE and mannitol, compared to on methanol. GABA production levels under these conditions were however low compared to growth on methanol. We present the first fed-batch mannitol fermentation of B. methanolicus and production of 6.3 g/l cadaverine. Finally, we constructed a recombinant MGA3 strain synthesizing the C30 terpenoids 4,4′-diaponeurosporene and 4,4′-diapolycopene, experimentally confirming that B. methanolicus has a functional methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Together, our results contribute to extending the range of both the feedstocks for growth and products that can be synthesized by B. methanolicus. © Copyright © 2020 Hakvåg, Nærdal, Heggeset, Kristiansen, Aasen and Brautaset.

AB  - Abstract: Cellulophaga lytica is a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium in the genome of which there are many genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes. One of the enzymes named ClGP contains a glycoside hydrolase domain from the GH5 family and a polysaccharide lyase domain from the PL31 family. The enzyme also contains the TAT signaling peptide and the TIGR04183 domain that indicates extracellular nature of the enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the enzymes most closely related to ClGP and containing all four domains (TAT, GH5, PL31, TIGR04183) are widespread among bacterial species belonging to the Flavobacteriaceae family. ClGP produced by the recombinant strain of E. coli was purified and characterized. ClGP exhibited activity of endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) and catalyzed hydrolysis of β-D-glucan, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), and amorphous cellulose, but failed to hydrolyze microcrystalline cellulose and xylan. Products of CMC hydrolysis were cellobiose and cellotriose, whereas β-D-glucan was hydrolyzed to glucose, cellobiose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose. ClGP was more active against the poly-β-D-mannuronate blocks than against the poly-α-L-glucuronate blocks of alginic acid. This indicates that the enzyme is a polyM lyase (EC 4.2.2.3). ClGP was active against polyglucuronic acid, so it displayed a glucuronan lyase (EC 4.2.2.14) activity. The enzyme had a neutral pH-optimum, was stable in the pH range 6.0-8.0, and displayed moderate thermal stability. ClGP effectively saccharified two species of brown algae, Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata, that suggests its potential for use in the production of biofuel from macroalgae. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - More than a century has passed since Kikunae Ikeda identified sodium l-glutamate as the umami component of 'kombu', a kind of seaweed. Since then, many novel physiological functions and new applications of amino acids have been revealed. The biosynthetic pathways of amino acids are tightly controlled by several regulation mechanisms that ensure specific amino acids do not accumulate and homeostasis is maintained. Therefore, the attempt to overproduce a specific amino acid was challenging. It has been a competition between cellular regulation mechanisms and the sophisticated innovations of humans. The cellular regulation mechanisms have been solved along with the development of molecular biology and methods for the production of various amino acids by fermentation and enzymes have been developed. In this chapter, typical regulation mechanisms of the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids are illustrated and how they have been overcome are described. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

AB  - Widespread use of antimicrobial drugs has led to high levels of drug-resistance in pathogen populations and a need for novel sources of anti-bacterial and anti-parasitic compounds. Macroalgae (seaweed) are potentially a rich source of bioactive compounds, and several species have traditionally been used as vermifuges. Here, we investigated the anti-parasitic properties of four common cold-water Nordic seaweeds; Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), Laminaria digitata, Saccharina latissima and Ascophyllum nodosum (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae). Screening of organic extracts against helminths of swine (Ascaris suum) and sheep (Teladorsagia circumcincta) revealed that S. latissima and L. digitata had particularly high biological activity. A combination of molecular networking and bio-guided fractionation led to the isolation of six compounds from extracts of these two species identified in both fermented and non-fermented samples. The six isolated compounds were tentatively identified by using MS-FINDER as five fatty acids and one monoglyceride: Stearidonic acid (1), Eicosapentaenoic acid (2), Alpha-Linolenic acid (3), Docosahexaenoic acid (4), Arachidonic acid (5), and Monoacylglycerol (MG 20:5) (6). Individual compounds showed only modest activity against A. suum, but a clear synergistic effect was apparent when selected compounds were tested in combination. Collectively, our data reveal that fatty acids may have a previously unappreciated role as natural anti-parasitic compounds, which suggests that seaweed products may represent a viable option for control of intestinal helminth infections. © Copyright © 2021 Bonde, Bornancin, Lu, Simonsen, Martínez-Valladares, Peña-Espinoza, Mejer, Williams and Thamsborg.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest public health threats of our time, and the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, of which there are numerous drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains, is a pathogen of worldwide concern. Scientists are turning their focus to underexplored marine ecosystems to identify novel antibacterial agents effective against S. aureus. Here, we report inhibition of S. aureus strains Newman and USA300 by extracts from Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), grown and harvested in the Western Gulf of Maine, USA. We examined how time of harvest throughout the growing season as well as the drying method pre-extraction affected the antimicrobial activity of the kelp extracts. Optimal antimicrobial activity was observed at the beginning of April (203 days since sporing), when increased water pH and higher salinity levels were also observed. Oven-dried crude extracts showed greater inhibition against S. aureus Newman, whereas freeze-dried crude extracts demonstrated greater inhibition against S. aureus USA300. Overall, our data indicate that cultivated S. latissima from the Western Gulf of Maine possesses significant value-added antimicrobial activity and identify early spring as an optimal harvest time to harness antimicrobial activity. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Diseases increasingly threaten aquaculture of kelps and other seaweeds. At the same time, protection concepts that are based upon application of biocides are usually not applicable, as such compounds would be rapidly diluted in the sea, causing ecological damage. An alternative concept could be the application of immune stimulants to prevent and control diseases in farmed seaweeds. We here present a pilot study that investigated the effects of oligoalginate elicitation on juvenile and adult sporophytes of Saccharina japonica cultivated in China and on adult sporophytes of Saccharina latissima cultivated in Germany. In two consecutive years, treatment with oligoalginate clearly reduced the detachment of S. japonica juveniles from their substrate curtains during the nursery stage in greenhouse ponds. Oligoalginate elicitation also decreased the density of endobionts and the number of bacterial cells on sporophytes of S. latissima that were cultivated on sea-based rafts. However, the treatment increased the susceptibility of kelp adults to settlement of epibionts (barnacles in Germany and filamentous algal epiphytes in China). In addition, oligoalginate elicitation accelerated the aging of S. japonica adults. Based upon these findings, oligoalginate elicitation could be a feasible way to provide “environmentally friendly” protection of kelp juveniles in nurseries. The same treatment causes not only beneficial, but also unwanted effects in adult kelp sporophytes. Therefore, it is not recommended as a treatment after the juvenile stage is completed. Future tests with other elicitors and other cultivated seaweed species may allow for the development of more feasible applications of targeted defense elicitation in seaweed aquaculture. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - To substitute petroleum-based materials with bio-based alternatives, microbial fermentation combined with inexpensive biomass is suggested. In this study Saccharina latissima hydrolysate, candy-factory waste, and digestate from full-scale biogas plant were explored as substrates for lactic acid production. The lactic acid bacteria Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus were tested as starter cultures. Sugars released from seaweed hydrolysate and candy-waste were successfully utilized by the studied bacterial strains. Additionally, seaweed hydrolysate and digestate served as nutrient supplements supporting microbial fermentation. According to the highest achieved relative lactic acid production, a scaled-up co-fermentation of candy-waste and digestate was performed. Lactic acid reached a concentration of 65.65 g/L, with 61.69% relative lactic acid production, and 1.37 g/L/hour productivity. The findings indicate that lactic acid can be successfully produced from low-cost industrial residues. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Kelp habitats contribute to marine productivity and diversity, making understanding the constraints on their distribution important. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Alaria esculenta occupies a subset of Saccharina latissima's range. Since tolerance to sedimentation by early life stages was suggested to cause this contrasting distribution, we tested the influence of sediment levels on spore attachment and development. For both species, the proportion of attached spores that developed decreased with increasing sediment. However, spore attachment and gametophyte density increased with sediment concentration but only for Saccharina. At the maximum sediment level examined, spore attachment and gametophyte densities of the two species were similar, contrary to the idea that sediment effects on early life stages explain differences in adult distribution. Further investigation, particularly with higher sediment loads, is required to confirm this conclusion. As turbidity is increasing globally, understanding the mechanisms underpinning changes in seaweed distribution will facilitate appropriate local-scale management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae are an underexploited source of natural bioactive compounds in Western countries, so an increasing interest in the valorization of these marine organisms has emerged in recent years. In this work, the effect of extracting solvent on the extraction yield, phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and antimicrobial activity of nine brown macroalgae species (Ascophyllum nodosum, Himanthalia elongata, Undaria pinnatifida, Pelvetia canaliculata, Saccharina latissima, Bifurcaria bifurcata, Laminaria ochroleuca, Sargassum muticum, and Fucus spiralis) was assessed. Total phenolic content (TPC) and the antioxidant properties of extracts by different assays: radical scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were performed. The antimicrobial activity of extracts was studied against six different foodborne microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, and Pseudomonas ae-ruginosa. The highest extraction yield was achieved in ethanolic extracts. However, the highest TPC and FRAP values were obtained on the ethyl acetate extracts, especially from A. nodosum. Concern-ing algal species, the highest TPC and FRAP values were found in A. nodosum, while the highest DPPH-RSA values were achieved in the hexane extracts of B. bifurcata. The antimicrobial activity of algal extracts varied according to the solvent and alga selected, suggesting the species-and solvent-dependent behavior of this property, with B. bifurcata extracts showing the highest results for a wide range of bacteria. Our results provide insight on the characterization of widespread brown algae in the coasts of the North-Western region of the Iberian Peninsula, reflecting multiple health-enhanc-ing properties which may lead to their exploitation in food, pharmacological, and cosmetic indus-tries. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of Saccharina latissima with laminarinase was compared to hydrolysis with different combinations of cellulase and hemicellulase enzyme mixtures. The hemicellulase mixture resulted in similar release of glucose, while the cellulase mixture released 40% more glucose than laminarinase alone. The combination of a laminarinase augmented with a cellulase mixture resulted in a 53% increase of glucose release from S. latissima than laminarinase. Increasing biomass loading above 4% (w/v) reduced the sugar yield. Resulting macroalgae hydrolysates were used as a carbon source for the production of pinene, making use of a novel two plasmid Escherichia coli system. The macroalgal hydrolysates were suitable for the novel microbial production of pinene with no further treatment and/or purification. © 2015.

AB  - The feeding of medicinal zinc oxide (ZnO) to weaner piglets will be phased out after 2022 in Europe, leaving pig producers without options to manage post-weaning disorders. This study assessed whether rapeseed meal, fermented alone (FRM) or co-fermented with a single (Ascophylum nodosum; FRMA), or two (A. nodossum and Saccharina latissimi; FRMAS) brown macroalagae species, could improve weaner piglet performance and stimulate intestinal development as well as maturation of gut microbiota in the absence of in-feed zinc. Weaned piglets (n = 1240) were fed, during 28-85 days of age, a basal diet with no additives (negative control; NC), 2500 ppm in-feed ZnO (positive control; PC), FRM, FRMA or FRMAS. Piglets fed FRM and FRMA had a similar or numerically improved, respectively, production performance compared to PC piglets. Jejunal villus development was stimulated over NC in PC, FRM and FRMAS (gender-specific). FRM enhanced colon mucosal development and reduced signs of intestinal inflammation. All fermented feeds and PC induced similar changes in the composition and diversity of colon microbiota compared to NC. In conclusion, piglet performance, intestinal development and health indicators were sustained or numerically improved when in-feed zinc was replaced by FRM. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Post-harvest changes in the quality of cut and whole S. latissima upon 23 days storage with or without acidification at different temperatures were studied by bacterial counts, amino acids composition, and 1H-NMR profiling of extracted metabolites. Lowering the temperature inhibited bacterial growth, and seaweed stored 10 days at 4°C had the same bacterial counts as seaweed stored 2 days at room temperature. Cutting reduced the bacterial degradation of mannitol, free amino acids, and other low molecular components but made proteins and carbohydrates more available for enzymatic hydrolysis. Acidification hindered microbial growth and reduced degradation of amino acids and other components. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The biological activities of Porphyra sp., Gracilaria gracilis, Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima extracts prepared by enzymatic and ball milling-assisted methods and hot water were evaluated. Enzyme-assisted methods allowed the highest extraction yields. Alcalase-assisted extraction (EAA) was the most effective in the recovery of polyphenolic compounds and Porphyra sp. had the highest content. The efficiency of flavonoids extraction was highly dependent on the used method. Globally, Porphyra sp. and EAA extracts exhibited the highest antioxidant and chelating activities. The highest α-amylase inhibitory activity was determined in HW Porphyra sp. extract while EAA A. esculenta extract had the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was obtained in EAA from S. latissima. None of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The results showed that Porphyra sp. and S. latissima are potentially useful as ingredient in functional foods and nutraceuticals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Kelp forests dominate temperate rocky shores worldwide but are declining globally with consequences for organisms that depend on them. In NW Iberia, the golden kelp (Laminaria ochroleuca) commonly occurs alongside a fast-growing annual that, unlike the golden kelp, does not seem to have receded in recent times (Saccorhiza polyschides). Here, we assessed whether the bulbous holdfast of S. polyschides could replace the intricate holdfast of L. ochroleuca as epifaunal habitat provider. Richness, diversity and total abundance of epifauna was similar in both seaweeds, while colonial/encrusting fauna was more abundant in L. ochroleuca. More importantly, each host supported a distinctive assemblage structure, indicating that S. polyschides seems an unsuitable replacement for L. ochroleuca as habitat provider for holdfast epifauna. Therefore, while S. polyschides may contribute substantially to the kelp forest canopy in some seasons, a regional decline of L. ochroleuca will likely alter the patterns of biodiversity within kelp stands. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Marine algae represents a sustainable feedstock in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) due to its low water and energy requirements for cultivation, higher capacity to sequester carbondioxide, and high carbohydrate content. Two-compartment MFCs were evaluated under batch-fed mode using Laminaria saccharina as the model for algae-based electron donor, and mixed microbial consortia as the biocatalyst, in the anode compartment. The Laminaria-based MFCs (LBMs) were studied with three different pretreatment conditions for the L. saccharina: (i) autoclaving (Auto), (ii) microwave irradiation (Micro), and (iii) as received treatment (No-Treat). A control was setup to establish base line performance for two-compartment MFCs using glucose as the electron donor in the anode. The performance of LBMs (250mW/m2 and 900mA/m2) was on par with glucose-based MFCs. AC impedance analysis revealed that the charge transfer resistance was at least 50-fold higher than the corresponding ohmic losses in both LBMs and glucose-based MFCs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Laminarin is a low-molecular-weight polysaccharide found in seaweed (kelp), often in equal concentrations to that in the commercially important hydrocolloid alginate. However, while alginate can be easily recovered by dissolution followed by acid precipitation, for laminarin, there is no such straightforward way of recovering it. Laminarin can be used as dietary fiber and, if efficiently extracted, it may be used for functional food/feed applications and as a component in plant defense stimulants for agriculture. One way of concentrating laminarin from dilute solutions is to press the solution through ultrafine membranes that the molecules cannot pass through. When alginate is extracted, an acid pretreatment step is used and the dilute acid residue from that process also contains laminarin. We used cross-flow filtration to concentrate laminarin from Saccharina latissima, retrieving it from the dilute acid solution of the acid pretreatment of an alginate extraction. Three ceramic membranes with 5, 15, and 50 kDa molecular weight cutoffs were used, and the pressure, temperature, and feed velocity were altered to reveal which parameters controlled the flow through the membrane and how efficiently laminarin was concentrated. The effects on laminarin extraction for fresh vs. frozen biomass were evaluated showing that frozen biomass releases more laminarin with a similar biomass homogenization technique. Thermal and microbial degradation of the feed components was studied during the course of the filtrations, showing that microbial degradation can affect the laminarin concentration, while the temperature of the process ~ 65 °C had little impact on laminarin. The techniques used to monitor the components in the feed and permeate during filtration were nuclear magnetic resonance, 1H-NMR, and size exclusion chromatography. The filtrations were performed in a pilot-size filtration unit with ceramic membranes (ZrO2/TiO2, TiO2-Al2O support, 0.08 m2). To be able to operate without quick membrane fouling, the most important parameter was to have a high liquid velocity over the membrane, 4.7 m s−1. A good technique to concentrate laminarin was to prefilter it through a 50-kDa membrane using 2 bar liquid pressure and to concentrate it over a 5-kDa membrane using 5-bar liquid pressure. With these settings, the liquid flux through the filter became 60–80 and 30–40 L m−2 h−1 over the 50-kDa and 5-kDa membrane. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Increasing global demand for food has generated a need for new strategies to feed a fast-growing population. Oceans appear as a sustainable solution, providing alternative sources of food such as macroalgae. These sea vegetables have high nutritional value and provide functional and health benefits. The sugar kelp Saccharina latissima is an emerging edible seaweed used mainly for human consumption. Although much is known about its biochemical compositions its lipidome remains unexplored. The aim of the present study was to characterize the polar lipid profile of S. latissima using a lipidomic-mass spectrometry HILIC-LC-MS based analysis. This approach allowed the identification of 197 molecular species of polar lipids, including glycolipids, phospholipids and betaine lipids. Several molecular species identified are carriers of polyunsaturated fatty acids with nutritional value and have been reported with anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-proliferative activity. Saccharina latissima is an emerging candidate to promote blue biotechnology inspired by the ocean. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emerging knowledge shows the importance of preweaning nutrition on programming the gastrointestinal microbiome and development of the gut barrier function. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of supplementing cow milk with either intact dried Ulva sp., Ascophyllum nodosum, or Saccharina latissima on growth performance and several gut health parameters of preweaning dairy calves. Forty male Holstein calves were selected based on birth weight (41 ± 4 kg) and plasma Brix percentage (≥8.7%) at d 2 of life. From d 2 to d 42 of life, the control calves (n = 10) were fed with cow milk (8 L/d) without seaweed supplementation, and the experimental calves were fed with cow milk (8 L/d) supplemented with either Ulva sp. (n = 10), A. nodosum (n = 10), or S. latissima (n = 10) at a concentration of 50 g/8 L of cow milk per day (i.e., 5% on a dry matter basis). Calves were weighed every week, and body weight gain and calf starter intake were monitored weekly. At d 42 ± 3 of life, calves were slaughtered. The organ weights and digesta pH from the reticulorumen, mid- and end small intestine, and mid-colon were recorded. A tissue sample (5 cm) collected from the mid-small intestine was analyzed for histomorphology. Digesta from the mid-small intestine and mid-colon were analyzed for lactobacilli, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae, and short-chain fatty acid profile. Weight gain of the calves was not affected by seaweed supplementation. Proportional organ weights were not affected by seaweed supplementation except for reticulorumen weight, which was higher in calves fed Ulva sp. Both the mid-small intestinal and mid-colonic digesta populations of lactobacilli, Enterobacteriaceae, and E. coli, as well as the mid-small intestinal histomorphology in seaweed-supplemented calves were not different from control calves. However, acetic acid proportion in mid-colonic digesta was increased in calves fed Ulva sp. and A. nodosum, whereas butyric acid proportion was decreased compared with the control calves. Digesta pH in mid- and end small intestine and mid-colon were not affected, whereas ruminal pH was increased in calves fed Ulva sp. compared with the control calves. In conclusion, intact dried seaweed supplementation did not improve the growth or selected gut health parameters (i.e., histomorphology, digesta pH, bacteria, and short-chain fatty acids) in preweaning Holstein calves. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association

AB  - Rapid deterioration of harvested macroalgal biomass is a challenge for macroalgal industry and can be overcome with the inexpensive ensiling preservation. To improve silage quality, Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta biomass was subjected to ensiling conditions following a 2 × 4 factorial design, with 2 prewilting treatments (no-prewilting and prewilted to 300 g DM kg−1 fresh biomass) and 4 additive treatments (no additive, formic acid, single and two species of Lactobacillus inoculant), and ensiled for 3 or 12 months at 15 °C. Acetate was the main fermentation product in these seaweed silages. Prewilting reduced the acetate, mannitol, and NH3 content in silages. In S. latissima silages without additives, prewilting led to less acidification (pH = 5.7). Also, prewilting caused protein and phlorotannin degradation. When treated with formic acid, the silage pH was below 4 regardless of the biomass’s moisture content. The use of Lactobacillus spp. inoculants was essential for lactate production in seaweed silages, and it significantly lowered silage pH in S. latissima and prewilted A. esculenta compared to silages with no additives. A high level of the phlorotannin content was preserved (> 90%) in the 3-month A. esculenta silages without prewilting. However, major reduction of antioxidant activity was observed in 12-month silages in both seaweed species. In conclusion, ensiling is a viable method for preserving Alaria and Saccharina biomass. Prewilting restricted silage fermentation, and both formic acid and bacterial additives facilitated silage acidification. However, there was no clear benefit of these treatments in preserving the antioxidant activity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Intact seaweed or seaweed extracts are used as feed supplements to improve the gut microbiome in young animals. Seaweeds provide functional polysaccharides, and they are a good source of vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds, all of which are relevant for immune system development. However, literature on the effects of dried seaweed supplementation on immune system development is limited, especially in calves. This experiment aimed to study the effect of feeding milk supplemented with Ulva lactuca, Ascophyllum nodosum, or Saccharina latissima on the systemic immune status of preweaning dairy calves. Forty male Holstein calves with birth body weight 41 ± 4 kg and plasma Brix percentage ≥8.7% at d 2 after birth were used in this study. Calves were fed 4 L of cow milk twice a day (total 8 L/d). From d 2 to d 28, calves in the control group (n = 10) received milk without seaweed supplementation. Over the same period, experimental calves received milk supplemented with Ulva lactuca (SW1; n = 10), Ascophyllum nodosum (SW2; n = 10), or Saccharina latissima (SW3, n = 10). Dried and ground seaweeds were offered at a daily allowance of 50 g/8 L of milk (i.e., approximately 5% inclusion rate on a dry matter basis). Blood samples were collected from a jugular vein on d 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after birth. Plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins, and acute-phase proteins (i.e., serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, and haptoglobin) were measured. We detected no differences in average daily gain, plasma immunoglobulins, albumin, or total protein. However, the contrast analysis revealed that plasma concentrations of fibrinogen (SW1 and SW2) and serum amyloid A (SW2 and SW3) were significantly higher in the seaweed groups compared with the control group. We also found a tendency for high plasma haptoglobin in the seaweed groups (SW1 and SW2) compared with the control group. Differences in acute-phase protein concentrations could be partially explained by the large differences in micromineral intake between control and seaweed-supplemented calves. Feeding milk supplemented with dried seaweed increased plasma concentrations of variables related to the innate immune response in preweaning dairy calves. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association

AB  - Kombu seaweed (Laminaria ochroleuca) was preserved by refrigeration at 5 °C (control), by high pressure processing (HPP) at 400 or 600 MPa for 5 min followed by refrigeration at 5 °C, or by freezing at −24 °C. Those treatments were applied to both unsalted and salted kombu samples, which were stored for 180 days. One hundred three compounds belonging to 16 chemical groups were identified in the volatile fraction of kombu. Groups including the highest number of volatile compounds were alcohols (24), aldehydes (13), ketones (10), alkanes (9), haloalkanes (9), alkenes (8) and acids (7). HPP lowered the levels of acids, aldehydes, ketones, lactones + ionones, pyranones and terpenes + terpenoids, and increased alkenes and furans. Freezing lowered the levels of alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, pyranones and terpenes + terpenoids, and increased aldehydes, haloalkanes and thiazoles. Salting lowered the levels of pyranones, and increased acids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, furans, haloalkanes, lactones + ionones and thiazoles. Control kombu odour acceptance fell below rejection level on day 60 while HPP-treated kombu showed the highest odour acceptance until day 180. Frozen kombu exhibited abnormal odours whereas salted kombu maintained acceptable odour characteristics. Principal component analysis associated the most relevant groups of volatile compounds with kombu microbiological and sensory characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Kombucha is a symbiotic system including synergistic effects of yeasts and acetic acid bacteria, produced by the fermentation of tea leaves and the incorporation of kombucha cultures under aerobic conditions. In this study, kombucha samples were produced using different tea leaves (white, green, oolong, black and pu-erh), and the number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), total yeast (TM), total acetic acid (TAA) and total gluconobacter (TGB) were determined in these samples during the fermentation of 21 days (30°C, dark conditions). Moreover, the survival rates of the present microbiota were investigated by using the in vitro artificial gastrointestinal model depending on the various fermentation periods. On the 12th day of fermentation, the highest vitality rates were obtained for acetic acid bacteria (91.16-99.61%) and gluconobacteria (90.84-99.37%) in artificial gastrointestinal model. At the end of the fermentation period, TAA and TGB counts were 7.77-10.66 and 7.68-9.68 log cfu/mL, respectively. LAB counts increased first, followed by a reduction of 60% due to high acidity (11.17 g/L, as acetic acid) and a decrease in pH (2.82). In terms of antibacterial activity; E. coli was the most sensitive microorganism and Lactobacillus acidophilus was the most resistant microorganism to the elevated acidity. The Kombucha tea produced by Pu-erh tea leaves had the highest antibacterial effect on the microorganisms investigated (p<0.05). In terms of the industrial production of Kombucha tea and the viability of the probiotics, it was concluded that the ideal fermentation period should be 2 weeks, and the fermentation conditions should be standardized in order to maintain its functional properties. © 2019 Authors.

AB  - Ensiling was investigated as a long-term storage method for preserving brown seaweed biomass (sugar kelp, Saccharina latissima (Phaeophyceae)) for subsequent use e.g. in a year-round biorefinery context where value-added constituents should be recovered for further formulation. Sugar kelp ensiling trials were carried out in lab-scale and pilot-scale with up to one-year duration, by either biological ensiling by means of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation or by chemical ensiling by addition of lactic acid to reduce pH. The results clearly demonstrated that the ensilability of sugar kelp was positively correlated with the initial glucose content which was partly consumed by LAB for obtaining and maintaining low pH. The ensiling process could be optimized by initial addition of molasses and further by addition of commercial LAB inoculum. The dose of molasses was important for pH development during biological ensiling. Similarly, initial addition of lactic acid was important for obtaining an effective chemical ensiling. Biological ensiling reduced the content of native glucose from sugar kelp and increased the content of fermentation products, primarily lactic acid. Addition of either molasses + LAB inoculum or lactic acid reduced the degradation of total amino acids during ensiling. Freezing prior to ensiling hampered the ensiling process but could be compensated for by addition of LAB. In conclusion, ensiling can be used for long-term storage of seaweed biomass, however, the ensiling process alters the biomass composition and, hence, the quality for subsequent use in biorefinery processes. The fate of higher-value components during ensiling needs further investigation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Yeast is a microbial feed ingredient that can be produced from non-food biomasses. Brown seaweed contains high levels of complex carbohydrates that are not digested to any extent by monogastric animals but can be used as carbon sources for yeast production. The objective of this study was to investigate how minerals originating from brown macroalgae (Saccharina latissima) are incorporated in Cyberlindnera jadinii yeast and to assess the bioavailability of these different minerals as well as their accumulation into different organs of Atlantic salmon. The yeast C. jadinii was produced on a seaweed hydrolysate mixed with a sugar-rich wood hydrolysate in a 9:1 volume ratio and fed to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in two different experiments: a digestibility experiment with 30% dietary inclusion of yeast and a retention experiment with increasing inclusion of yeast (5, 10, and 20%). Seaweed minerals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iodine (I), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co) were incorporated to a high degree in the yeast. The apparent fecal excretion of minerals was similar in both experiments, in general, with low excretion of, I, bromine (Br), and arsenic (As) (ranging from 18.0% to 63.5%) and high excretion of iron (Fe), Cu, Mn, aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) (ranging from 56.9% to <100%), despite the different fish size and fecal sampling method. High levels of Cu, I, Br, and Co in the yeast resulted in a linear decrease (p < 0.05) in retention of these minerals in salmon fed increasing levels of yeast. Despite increasing amounts of these minerals in the feed, whole-body levels of Cu and Mn remained stable, whereas whole-body levels of Co, somewhat unexpectedly, decreased with increased dietary yeast inclusion. The Cd from the yeast had low bioavailability but was concentrated more in the kidney (0.038 mg kg−1) and liver (0.025 mg kg−1) than in muscle (0.0009 mg kg−1). The given Cd level in fish strengthens the indication that it is safe to feed salmon with up to 20% inclusion of seaweed yeast without exceeding the maximum limit for Cd of 0.05 mg kg−1 w.w. in fish meat. The level and retention (p < 0.05) of As were lower in the yeast compared to fishmeal. The high level of iodine in S. latissima (3900 mg kg−1) was partly transferred to the yeast, and salmon fed increasing levels of yeast displayed a linear increase in whole-body I content (p < 0.05). There is, however, a need for a growth experiment with larger fish to draw any firm conclusions regarding food safety. Overall, this study shows that yeast grown on hydrolyzed seaweed can be a suitable mineral source for Atlantic salmon, especially when diets are low in fishmeal. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of methanol and acetone brown algal species extracts: Kombu (Laminaria japonica), Wakame (Undaria pinnatifida), Arame (Eisenia bicyclis) and a red algal sample Sushi Nori (Porphyra tenera) was determined in this study against gram positive and gram negative bacterial isolates; some are antibiotic resistant such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 12498 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and against a yeast isolate Candida albicans ATCC 60193.The highest antimicrobial activity was noted mainly with the brown methanolic algal extracts compared to red algal extracts. FTIR infrared Spectrometer analysis together with High performance liquid chromatography provided a detailed description of the functional chemical constituents present in marine macroalgae particularly in brown seaweeds to be mainly of phenolic nature to which the potent antimicrobial activity is being attributed; nano particles measurement with zeta sizer for Laminaria japonica acetone extract could indicate a preliminary correlation between stability and efficacy of the algal extracts.

AB  - Pseudomonas strains were shown to be regularly associated with the brown macroalga Saccharina latissima from the Baltic Sea, studied over several years, and were identified as producers of the antimicrobially active compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. These findings support the assumption of a stable association between the Pseudomonas spp. strains and S. latissima in the Baltic Sea. The metabolite profile of the Pseudomonas spp. comprised mono acetylphloroglucinol, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyoluteorin and several rhizoxins, which exhibited broad-spectrum antibiotic activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as against fungi. Because the antibiotic activities included the inhibition of the 2 algal pathogens Pseudoalteromonas elyakovii and Algicola bacteriolytica, we propose a beneficial effect of these marine pseudomonads on their host S. latissima. © Inter-Research 2012.

AB  - Nourishment of the growing human population requires new and alternative food sources, preferable produced without occupying new land areas. Cultivation of seaweed presents an opportunity, however, a major obstacle is sustainable preservation. Fermentation has been used for centuries to preserve vegetables, e.g., to produce kimchi based on cabbage. This study investigated changes in the microbiota, characteristics (pH, organic acids and water soluble carbohydrates) and food safety of raw shredded Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima during fermentation by the natural microbiota with or without addition of a Lactiplantibacillus plantarum starter culture. The Lb. plantarum fermented products retained a high Shannon diversity index, indicating a partially unsuccessful fermentation. Lb. plantarum performed better in A. esculenta causing pH to drop to below 4.6, a critical limit for control of growth of Clostridium botulinum, within 2 days compared to 7 days for S. latissima. Natural fermentation by the endogenous microbiota resulted in unsafe products with high final pH values (4.8–5.2), presence of unwanted organic acids, such as butyric acid, and in the case of A. esculenta sustenance of inoculated Listeria monocytogenes. Fermentation of A. esculenta and S. latissima by Lb. plantarum is a promising preservation method. However, future work is needed to optimise the process, by investigation of the use of different starter cultures, seaweed pre-treatments (blanching, freezing, etc.) and adjuvants (i.e., addition of sugars, minerals and similar) to promote growth of the starter culture and ensure the fermented products are safe to eat. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Global demand for seaweed is increasing, resulting in the rapid growth of the seaweed industry. To sustain and enhance the industry (seaweed growers and processors), it is essential to establish and optimize post-harvest food processing practices to extend the shelf life of the fresh, edible product. Blanching and freezing were applied in this study to offer longer-term storage to enable the distribution of sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima), farm-raised in Maine, USA. The objectives were to evaluate blanching, specifically the impacts of blanching method (direct immersion or vacuum packaged), temperature (80 or 100 °C) and time (5 or 30 s), kelp form (whole blade or shredded), and the effects of frozen storage on food product qualities including color, texture, drip loss, mineral content, total phenolic content, and the native microflora of sugar kelp after thawing. The fresh brown kelp developed a vivid green color immediately after blanching, especially with higher blanching temperature and longer blanching time. Drip loss was higher in blades than in shredded slaw, and vacuum packaged blanching produced higher moisture content, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity. Results substantiate the importance of the blanching method, temperature, and time on frozen kelp quality. Blanching prior to freezing resulted in relatively higher product quality than unblanched frozen kelp despite some losses in hardness and color. Frozen storage had minimal to no impact on texture, aerobic plate count, and psychrotrophic microorganisms. Higher temperature, longer time, and vacuum packaged blanching is suggested to extend the marketable shelf life of sugar kelp to at least 6 months at − 20 °C. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Bacteria including Vibrio spp. persist in coastal waters and can contaminate edible seaweeds. Pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC), and Salmonella have been associated with and present serious health risks in minimally processed vegetables including seaweeds. This study evaluated the survival of four pathogens inoculated onto two product forms of sugar kelp subjected to different storage temperatures. The inoculation comprised of a cocktail of two Listeria monocytogenes and STEC strains, two Salmonella serovars, and two Vibrio species. STEC and Vibrio were grown and applied in salt-containing media to simulate preharvest contamination, whereas L. monocytogenes and Salmonella inocula were prepared to simulate postharvest contamination. Samples were stored at 4°C and 10°C for 7 days, and 22°C for 8 h. Microbiological analyses were performed periodically (1, 4, 8, 24 h, etc.) to evaluate the effects of storage temperature on pathogen survival. Pathogen populations decreased under all storage conditions, but survival was greatest for all species at 22°C, with STEC exhibiting significantly less reduction (1.8 log CFU/g) than Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and Vibrio (3.1, 2.7, and 2.7 log CFU/g, respectively) after storage. The largest population reduction (5.3 log CFU/g) was observed in Vibrio stored at 4°C for 7 days. Regardless of storage temperature, all pathogens remained detectable at the end of the study duration. Results emphasize the need for strict adherence to temperature control for kelp as temperature abuse may support pathogen survival, especially STEC, during storage, and the need for prevention of postharvest contamination, particularly with Salmonella. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Kombucha is a fermented beverage obtained by the fermentation of tea extracts containing sugar by the symbiotic culture of acetic acid bacteria and yeasts. The consumption and studies about the Kombucha are increasing steadily. In this study, caper buds belonging to Capparis ovata Desf. obtained from the Artvin region in Turkey were utilized in Kombucha production; caper buds and Kombucha tea samples (KC1: Green-tea, KC2: Caper bud, KC3: Caper bud + Green-tea) were analyzed. The dry matter, water-soluble dry matter, ash and total acidity and pH of caper buds used in Kombucha tea production were determined as 25.99±1.12 g/100g, 14.47±0.21, 1.74±0.06 g/100g, 0.57±0.06 g/100g and 5.30±0.12, respectively. In Kombucha samples, at the end of fermentation, the total acidity ranged from 0.74±0.02 to 1.43±0.04 g/100g, while the pH was between 3.18±0.01 and 3.19±0.01. Although, caper buds did not contain any anthocyanin, KC1 sample had 2.30 mg/L (cyanidin-3-glycoside equivalent) anthocyanin and it increased by 52% and determined as 3.50 mg/L (cyanidin-3-glycoside equivalent) in KC3 sample by the inclusion of caper buds. In order to determine the potential of Kombucha tea samples on health, antioxidant capacity of samples were determined, and green tea and caper bud containing KC3 sample had the highest values in extractable (TEACABTS: 7.06 µmole Trolox/mL; TEACDPPH: 7.12 µmole Trolox/mL), hydrolyzable (TEACABTS: 7.59 µmole Trolox/mL; TEACCUPRAC: 4.28 µmole Trolox/mL; TEACDPPH: 3.03 µmole Trolox/mL) and bioaccessible phenolics (TEACABTS: 5.70 µmole Trolox/mL; TEACCUPRAC: 4.47 µmole Trolox/mL; TEACDPPH: 2.36 µmole Trolox/mL). In addition, according to sensory evaluation results, KC3 with 5.61 points was the most preferred sample by panelists (overall acceptability). As a result of the study, antioxidant capacity and total phenolic component contents of tea samples were enriched by using a phenolic compond rich substrate capers buds, and a new healthy fermented beverage was produced. © 2020 The authors.

AB  - In this work, we have compared the carbohydrate content and the enzymatic saccharification of the brown algae Macrocystis pyrifera from Chile and Saccharina latissima from Norway. M. pyrifera contained 40% mannitol, 31% uronic acids and 15% glucose, while S. latissima contained 37% glucose, 30% uronic acids and 25% mannitol. Thus, the ratio between mannitol and glucose was much higher for M. pyrifera. Acid pre-treated and untreated algae were enzymatically saccharified in two steps; first at pH 7.5, 25 °C for 12 h with a blend of recombinant alginate and oligoalginate lyases, then the pH was changed to 5.2, a commercial cellulase cocktail was added and saccharification continued at 50 °C for 4 h. These experiments showed that the use of recombinant alginate lyases and oligoalginate lyases in combination with cellulases increased the release of glucose from untreated seaweed. However, for saccharification of pretreated algae, only cellulases were needed to achieve high glucose yields. Finally, it was shown that brown algae hydrolysates could be used as a growth medium to produce microbial ingredients, such as Candida utilis yeast. © 2017

AB  - This study investigated seasonal variations in the composition of the kelp species Saccharina latissima cultivated on the Swedish west coast and, using an in vitro fermentation system, evaluated the effect of fermented whole S. latissima biomass or biomass components on the gut microbiota of broiler chickens. Caecal contents of six Ross 308 broilers fed a standard wheat and soy-based diet were retrieved on two different occasions, with three birds sampled per occasion. Two in vitro fermentation batches (A, B) were established using caecal contents as inoculum, and whole S. latissima, ethanol-washed S. latissima, laminarin extract or inulin (control) as substrate. Total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content, gas production, pH and changes in microbiota composition were studied after 6, 12 and 24 h of fermentation. Analysis of seasonal variations revealed that S. latissima harvested in June had the highest laminarin content and lowest ash and crude protein content. Broiler microbiota, SCFA profile, gas production and pH mainly varied depending on fermentation inoculum, but there were also some variations depending on substrate. For instance, uncultured bacterium from Clostridiales_vadinBB60_group showed higher relative abundance (RA) in batch A, while Faecalibacterium showed higher RA in batch B. Whole and ethanol-washed S. latissima resulted in highest RA of unclassified Ruminococcaceae and Tyzzerella for both batches, while ethanol-washed S. latissima and laminarin gave highest RA of Erysipelatoclostridium. Inulin resulted in highest RA for the genus Subdoligranulum. Acetic, n-butyric and propionic acid were the main fermentation products and total SCFA level was higher in batch B. Within batch B, inulin and laminarin generated higher levels of acetic and butyric acid. When using inulin and laminarin, gas production was lower in batch B compared with batch A. In summary, this study showed that S. latissima is a good source of laminarin, especially when harvested in summer. Within the in vitro system, the microbiota was affected by different substrates, but inoculum source was identified as an important contributor to microbial community development during fermentation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Loading macroalgae into existing anaerobic digestion (AD) plants allows us to overcome challenges such as low digestion efficiencies, trace elements limitation, excessive salinity levels and accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), observed while digesting algae as a single substrate. In this work, the co-digestion of the brown macroalgae Saccharina latissima with mixed municipal wastewater sludge (WWS) was investigated in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the organic loading rate (OLR) were fixed at 19 days and 2.1 g l−1 d−1 of volatile solids (VS), respectively. Initially, WWS was digested alone. Subsequently, a percentage of the total OLR (20%, 50% and finally 80%) was replaced by S. latissima biomass. Optimal digestion conditions were observed at medium-low algae loading (≤50% of total OLR) with an average methane yield close to 220 and 250 Nml g VS−1algae in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. The conductivity values increased with the algae loading without inhibiting the digestion process. The viscosities of the reactor sludges revealed decreasing values with reduced WWS loading at both temperatures, enhancing mixing properties. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ensiling preservation of three seaweed species (Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Ulva rigida and Saccharina latissima) produced in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system without or with a lactic acid bacteria inoculant after 24–48 hours wilting. The course of silage fermentation for a storage period up to nine weeks was also studied. The characteristics of fresh seaweeds suggested ensiling to be challenging. Overall, seaweeds presented a pH above 7.0, low dry matter (DM) content, and a non-structural polysaccharides content (DM basis) ranging from 14% (U. rigida) to 43% (S. latissima). The highest buffering capacity was recorded for U. rigida while the fermentation coefficient was higher for S. latissima, lower for U. rigida, and intermediate for G. vermiculophylla. The ensiling of S. latissima resulted in a pronounced lactic acid formation and a lower pH in comparison to the red and green seaweed silages. The ensilage of U. rigida and of G. vermiculophylla failed to decrease pH below 5.0 up to nine weeks, fermentation products suggesting the occurrence of a heterolactic fermentation or the promotion of heterofermentative bacteria and clostridia growth, respectively. The use of a lactic acid bacteria inoculant prior to ensiling had only minor effects on fermentation. Composition of seaweeds was generally preserved by ensilage, but in vitro digestibility of G. vermiculophylla was severely reduced. More research is needed to test different inoculants and dosages, and to assess the effects of seaweed silages on animal feed intake and performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a brown macroalgae species, Saccharina latissima, processed to increase its protein concentration, and a red macroalgae species, Porphyra spp., were used to evaluate their in vivo digestibility, rumen fermentation and blood amino acid concentrations. Four castrated rams were used, whose diets were supplemented with a protein-rich fraction of S. latissima, a commercial Porphyra spp. and soybean meal (SBM). Our results show that the protein digestibility of a diet with S. latissima extract was lower (0.55) than those with Porphyra spp. (0.64) and SBM (0.66). In spite of the higher nitrogen (N) intake of diets containing Porphyra spp. and SBM (20.9 and 19.8 g N/day, respectively) than that with S. latissima (18.6 g N/day), the ratio of N excreted in faeces to total N intake was significantly higher in the diet with S. latissima than those with Porphyra spp. and SBM. This reflects that the utilization of protein in S. latissima was impaired, possibly due to reduced microbial activity. The latter statement is corroborated by lower volatile fatty acid composition (25.6, 54.8 and 100 mmol/l for S. latissima, Porphyra spp. and SBM, respectively) and a non-significant tendency for lower ammonia concentration observed in diets with S. latissima and Porphyra spp. compared to SBM. It is important to note that the S. latissima used in this trial was rinsed during processing to remove salt. This process potentially also removes other water-soluble compounds, such as free amino acids, and may have increased the relative fraction of protein resistant to rumen degradation and intestinal absorption. Furthermore, the phlorotannins present in macroalgae may have formed complexes with protein and fibre, further limiting their degradability in rumen and absorption in small intestines. We recommend that further studies explore the extent to which processing of macroalgae affects its nutritive properties and rumen degradability, in addition to studies to measure the intestinal absorption of these macroalgae species. © 2019 The Animal Consortium

AB  - Marine macroalgae are covered by a biofilm community of bacteria and diatoms. In this study, the influences of macroalgae and their biofilm community on the settlement and behaviour of epibionts such as the blue mussel were examined. Under field conditions (White Sea, Kandalakshsky Gulf), larvae of Mytilus edulis settled predominantly on thalli of the filamentous green algae Cladophora rupestris compared to thalli of the brown macroalgae Laminaria saccharina and Fucus vesiculosus. In laboratory experiments biofilm and wash-outs from C. rupestris attracted larvae while those from L. saccharina repelled blue mussel larvae. Biofilm and wash-outs from F. vesiculosus had no behavioral effect on the larvae. In general, biofilm had the same effect on the behaviour of the larvae as the macroalgae themselves. Field experiments which were designed to decrease flow around substrates also demonstrated that thalli of C. rupestris attracted larvae, but those of L. saccharina repelled them. It is concluded that macroalgae and biofilm affect substrate selection by blue mussel larvae, both by excretion of signals (repellents or attractants) and toxic substances.

AB  - Laminaria saccharina, L. hyperborea and L. digitata (Laminariales, Phaeophyta) were cultivated at 0°C from embryospores. Slow germination of embryospores and temperature-limited growth of primary cells were found. Laminaria saccharina developed most rapidly and produced oogonia 18-20 days after sporulation, and sporophytes after 23-26 days. No differences were found in the rate of development of the primary cells between L. digitata and L. hyperborea; the first oogonia were observed after 20-34 days in L. hyperborea and after 33 days in L. digitata. Sporophytes were observed after 54-59 days in L. hyperborea, whereas the experiment with L. digitata had to be terminated after 42 days. The relatively rapid development of L. saccharina at 0°C suggests good adaptation of the gametophytic stage to Arctic conditions. The slow growth of L. hyperborea and L. digitata at 0°C suggests that this is close to the lowest temperature allowing vegetative development of primary cells of both species. Laminaria hyperborea produces spores during winter and L. digitata during late summer and autumn, and different seasons of gametophytic establishment may possibly explain why L. digitata extends into the Arctic, whereas L. hyperborea does not.

AB  - The fatty acid compositions of gonadal material was examined for the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris (Gmelin) held in aquaria and fed either salmon feed pellets or the macroalga, Laminaria saccharina for 18 months. Gonadal material was also examined from P. miliaris collected from four field sites, including commercial scallop lines encrusted with the mussel, Mytilus edulis, sea cages stocked with Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and two intertidal sea-loch sites, characterised by either a fine mud or a macroalgal substratum. The fatty acid compositions of known and potential dietary material was examined. The proportions of certain fatty acids in the gonads of P. miliaris were significantly affected by diet type and location, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 22:6 n - 3 was significantly higher in the gonads of the sea urchins fed salmon feed in aquaria and collected from the salmon cages and scallop lines than in the gonads of the sea urchins fed L. saccharina in aquaria and collected from the intertidal sea loch sites. The salmon feed and the mussel tissue also contained a high proportion of this fatty acid. Stearidonic acid 18:4 n - 3 and arachidonic acid 20:4 n - 6, however, were found in significantly higher proportions than DHA in the gonads of the sea urchins fed L. saccharina and collected from the two intertidal sea-loch sites. L. saccharina was also found to contain high proportions of stearidonic and arachidonic acid. The gonads of the sea urchins collected from the intertidal site, characterised by a mud substratum, and from the scallop lines were found to contain a lower 18:1 n - 9/18:1 n - 7 ratio and a higher proportion of branched and odd-chained fatty acids, signifying a high dietary bacterial input, than the sea urchins held in the aquaria and collected from the salmon cage. 20:2 and 22:2 non-methylene-interrupted dienoic fatty acids (NMIDs) were found in P. miliaris fed diets lacking these fatty acids suggesting de novo biosynthesis. These results, therefore, suggest that the proportions/ratios of certain fatty acids in the gonads of P. miliaris could be used to give an indication of the predominant diet type of this species in the wild. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Phlorotannins are considered inter alia to act protective to a variety of stressors, while lipids in spores are known to fuel various metabolic processes during spore release and settlement. Here, phlorotannin production in zoospores/juvenile gametophytes in relation to lipid metabolism was investigated for the first time in order to study-related metabolic costs. The experiment was carried out in Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard, Arctic) within the development from spores to juvenile gametophytes of the brown alga Saccharina latissima over 20 days. In the release stage, the total phlorotannin content of single zoospores was 1.5 × 10-7 μg and 1.9 × 10-7 μg in the surrounding medium. Upon release, the total amount of lipids was 1.76 × 10-5 μg lipid zoospore-1 containing the major fatty acids 16:0 and 18:0, 18:1(n-9), 18:2 (n-6), 18:3(n-3), 20:4(n-6), and 20:5(n-3). During development from spores to gametophytes, a decrease in fatty acids was observed via electron microscopy and a decrease in the fatty acid 18:1(n-9) from 45 to 30% was measured by gas chromatography in particular. While phlorotannin content within the spores remained stable, phlorotannins accumulated in the surrounding medium of gametophytes to 4. 0 × 10-7 μg phlorotannins spore-1 indicating exudation processes. Results obtained support the key and multifunctional role of lipids in zoospore/gametophyte metabolism and may indicate that gametophytes of S. latissima need approximately 10 days to switch to photo-autotrophic strategies, becoming independent of storage lipids. In addition, fatty acids might represent an essential energy source to fuel adaptive responses. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Twenty-two kinds of kombu were extracted with 70% ethanol. Then the extractives were passed through a column filled with an ion exchange resin, Dowex 50 X-4 (H-type, 20~50 mesh) to remove inorganic salts which were contained in high concentration in the seaweed; otherwise the growth of the test microorganisms would be disturbed. In this process, large amounts of arginine remained in the column when displaced with 0.2N-NH4OH because the compound is strongly alkaline. Seventeen amino acids in the extractives were determined by the microbiological assay method. The résulté are shown in Table 1. In order to clarify if the contents of any amino acid be one of the quality-influencing factors, these data were analyzed statistically in relation to the following 8 items: (1) Difference between ichiban-dashi and niban-dashi; (2) Harvesting season; (3) The grade in the market; (4) The sampling position of kombu lamina; (5) Locality of kombu plant; (6) Whether growing offshore or seashore; (7) First year or second year plant; (8) Kombu species. It was revealed through the analysis that the quality did not seem to be entirely influenced by the difference of amino acid composition. © 1961, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

AB  - Year-round induction of sporogenesis of Laminaria saccharina was performed by mechanically blocking the transport of the putative sporulation inhibitors produced by the blade meristem and culturing the plants in constant short days. Sporogenesis was successfully induced by removal of the blade meristem, either by cultivating distal blade fragments or by performing a transverse cut in the frond. The earliest sorus formation after artificial induction was 10 days. The age of the sporophytes used for induction was 6-11 months or 2 years in tank-grown or field-collected sporophytes, respectively. Zoospores were successfully released in all cases. Thus, by year-round artificial induction of sporogenesis, (1) sporeling production of L. saccharina and thereafter sporophyte cultivation could be achieved without seasonal limitation, and (2) the life cycle of L. saccharina (from spore to spore) could be completed within 8 months under controlled conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brown Irish edible seaweeds, Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria sachharina and Laminaria digitata, were evaluated for the microbiota in raw and heat processed form. Raw seaweeds showed complete absence of aerobic mesophiles, halophiles, yeasts and molds. However, heating at 85 °C for 15 min resulted in spore germination. Bacterial counts as high as 107 were observed for aerobic mesophiles and halophiles. Heating above 95 °C for 15 min resulted in complete inactivation of surface microflora. Bacteria belonging to Bacillaceae, Paenibacillaceae, Moraxellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae family were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. In vitro antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extracts of the seaweed on food pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria were also evaluated. The seaweeds in their raw state had almost 100% inhibition against Listeria monocytogenes; 98% and 93% inhibition was achieved against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by H. elongata and L. saccharina extracts, respectively. Heating the seaweeds resulted in the reduction of antimicrobial activity as compared to raw. The effect was more pronounced against Gram negative bacteria. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - A high-yield technique is described for the elaboration of single cell detritus (SCD) from Laminaria saccharina, based on the sequential action of C1H, enzymes (endoglucanases and cellulases) and 2 bacteria showing a high degree of cellobiotic, proteolytic, and alginolytic activity (CECT 5255 and CECT 5256). Over 85% of dried particles of L. saccharina were transformed into a suspension of free cell and bacterial and detrital particles after 24 hours of bacterial activity with this technique. These particles were less than 20 μm in diameter, constituting a suitable diet for bivalve mollusks. After 72 hours 99% of the total particulate volume consisted of particles less than 20 μm in diameter. Tests of hatchery diets for the seed of clam Ruditapes decussatus revealed increases of 54% and 68% for live weight and length, respectively, when SCD from L. saccharina was used as the sole dietary component compared with a live phytoplankton diet. However, SCD from L. saccharina is not a suitable food for the larvae of R. decussatus. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Bacterial communities associated with the brown alga Laminaria saccharina from the Baltic Sea and from the North Sea were investigated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The rhizoid, cauloid, meristem and phyloid revealed different 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis banding patterns indicating a specific association of bacterial communities with different parts of the alga. Associations with cauloid and meristem were more specific, while less specific associations were obtained from the old phyloid. In addition, seasonal and geographical differences in the associated communities were observed. Results from 16S rRNA gene libraries supported these findings. Bacterial phylotypes associated with the alga were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria (nine phylotypes), Gammaproteobacteria (nine phylotypes) and the Bacteroidetes group (four phylotypes). A number of bacteria associated with other algae and other marine macroorganisms were among the closest relatives of phylotypes associated with L. saccharina. © 2008 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Phlorotannins have often been considered to act as UV-protective compounds in zoospores of brown algae. However, only the absorption characteristics of zoospores under UV exposure have been determined and no data are available on the actual content of phlorotannins or on temperature-UV interactions. Therefore, we determined the absorbance spectra and the phlorotannin contents in zoospore suspensions of three Arctic species (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, Alaria esculenta), and in the media surrounding zoospores after exposure to different radiation (400-700, 320-700, 295-700 nm) and temperature (2-18°C) conditions for 8 h. Absorption typical of phlorotannins with a maximum at 276 nm was monitored in zoospore suspensions as well as in the media surrounding zoospores, but the results depended strongly on radiation treatments and on zoospore densities. Surprisingly, the content of UV-absorbing phlorotannins subsequent to different exposures did not change in any of the three species. The observed exceptional absorption properties could, therefore, not be related to phlorotannin contents. These findings are discussed in light of a strong phlorotannin investment from sporophytes during spore release and a minor UV-protective role of phlorotannins for zoospores of Arctic kelp species. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - The fauna, associated with Laminaria and other large brown macroalgae was studied by using SCUBA and dredging in two different types of underwater habitats of the White Sea. In shallow water fjords and bays, with a depth of no more than 30-40 m, detached kelp (mainly Laminaria saccharina, L. digitata and Alaria esculenta) formed large accumulations. One of these benthic accumulations, which has existed more than 20 years, was studied. It covers about 2000 m2, and is about 2 m thick. The upper layer of the accumulation of fronds is characterized by high turbulence and is well aerated. The lower layer is characterized by anoxic conditions. Mats of sulphur bacteria were not observed, although fronds in the middle layer were covered by layers of cyanobacteria. About 50 species of macroinvertebrates were found, mainly species that are normally associated with living kelp, such as the detritivorous species Ophiura robusta and Gammarus oceanicus, and few species that are specific inhabitants of organic-rich biotopes in the White Sea such as Capitella capitata, Ophryotrocha irinae and Nebalia bipes. It was remarkable that in the shallow water basins of the White Sea, the process of decomposition of brown algae in the sublittoral takes place without sea urchins, and no other macrofaunal form plays an ecological role in the mechanical breakdown of the plant substratum, even not in the large accumulations of detached kelp. Along the open rocky shoreline, communities associated with dead detached kelp were situated at a depth of 60-90 m, 40-50 m below the belt of living kelp. In this deep zone, no macroinvertebrates typical of the kelp community in the photic zone were found. During the passage from the shoreline to the deeper benthic community, where sea urchins were dominant, all plant debris became fragmented. These deeper benthic communities appeared to be the zone for decomposition of the detached kelp. ©1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The microbial degradation of North Sea macroalgae was studied in laboratory microcosms, containing autoclaved seawater and a mixture of equal parts of air-dried Delesseria sanguinea, Ulva lactuca, and Laminaria saccharina (red, green and brown algae, respectively). To determine the influence of different organisms on the decomposition rate (expressed in terms of algal dry weight loss relative to the material present at time zero) and their development during decomposition processes, yeast, flagellates, ciliates, nematodes and a harpacticoid copepod species were introduced to the microcosms. Results show that microbial degradation compared to the controls was enhanced in the presence of non-axenic nematodes (Monhystera sp.) and protozoans, including bacterivorous ciliates (Euplotes sp. and a Uronema-like sp.) and flagellates. No enhancement occurred with yeast (Debaryomyces hansenii) or with the harpacticoid copepod Tisbe holothuriae. The most rapid algal dry weight loss (78.7% after 14 d at 18°C) occurred with the addition of raw seawater sampled near benthic algal vegetation and containing only the natural microorganisms present. These consisted mainly of bacteria with different morphological properties, whereby their numbers alone (viable counts) could not be correlated with algal dry weight loss. Although no single dominant species could be determined, lemon yellow pigmented colonies were frequently found. During decomposition in all microcosms the formation of algal particles 40-400 μm was observed, which were rapidly colonized by the other organisms present. © 1990 Biologische Anstalt Helgoland.

AB  - Epibacterial communities on thalli of the algal species Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, Laminaria saccharina, Ulva compressa, Delesseria sanguinea and Phycodrys rubens were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based DGGE. Individuals of all species were collected in the Kiel Fjord (Baltic Sea) and in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland (North Sea). DGGE gels as well as cluster and multidimensional scaling analysis based on the DGGE band patterns of the epibacterial community showed significant differences between the epibacterial communities on the investigated algal species both in the Baltic and North Seas. Epibacterial communities differed less between regions than between host species, and were more similar on closely related host species. Results give the first evidence for lineage-specific bacterial associations to algal thalli. Furthermore, the results suggest that these algal species may control their epibiotic bacterial communities. © Inter-Research 2009.

AB  - Numerous marine organisms, including macroalgae, produce bioactive compounds. As chemical extraction processes do not distinguish between compounds originating from the alga and its associated microflora, a key step immediately prior to isolation of molecules, is elimination of epibionts from the alga studied. In chemical, ecological and biotechnological contexts, a clear identification of the source organism, when symbiotic interactions occurs, is crucial. We aimed to improve understanding of specific secondary metabolite production by macroalgae through development of a metho-dology for removing microbial epibionts immediately prior to chemical extraction without damaging algal cell surfaces (to avoid extraction of endogenous macroalgal compounds at this stage). Various solutions were tested: non-polar solvents (dichloromethane and hexane), alcohols (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol), oxidants (sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and iodine) and a natural product (tea tree oil) at various concentrations and contact times. Five macroalgal species were employed: Chondrus crispus, Fucus serratus, Palmaria palmata, Saccharina latissima and Ulva lactuca. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the surface integrity. The best epibiont removal rate without damaging tissue was obtained with mixtures of ethanol (40-50%) and sodium hypochlorite (1%). Interestingly, macroalgal moisture content influenced treatment efficacy.© 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2011.

AB  - The abundance of Aurelia and Cyanea scyphopolyps on Laminaria saccharina was higher in sheltered, shallow areas compared with more exposed or deep ones. Liberated planulae probably were not transported far away from stranded and trapped jellyfish and settled nearby, preferably in patches on the downward side of the Laminaria thallus. The principal prey for the scyphopolyps seems to be small copepods and the cladocerans Podon sp. and Evadne sp., which are abundant in surface waters during the summer. Temporarily abundant planktonic organisms, e.g., Sagitta setosa, Pleurobrachiapileus and hydromedusae might, also be important prey. Harpacticids, halacarideans and Corophium sp., whose natural habitat is on L. saccharina, were not captured by the scyphopolyps. Scyphopolyps cultured in running sea water rich in detritus and phytoplankton fill their enteron with organic substrates, particularly diatoms. A new category of heterotrichous microbasic rhopaloid nematocysts was identified in the scyphopolyps. These rhopaloids were earlier included within the euryteles and were not considered to be separate nematocysts. They are distinctive from the euryteles due to the two swellings on their discharged shaft. The absence or presence of the nudibranch Coryphella verrucosa on laminarian thalli possibly has an effect on the number of scyphopolyps, as this nudibranch consumes numerous scyphopolyps. Isorhizas and the new category of rhopaloid nematocysts, identical to those present in the Aurelia polyps, occurred in the cnidosacs of examined C. verrucosa. The proportion of rhopaloid nematocysts compared with a-isorhizas was noticeably higher in C. verrucosa than in scyphopolyps. The nudibranch may selectively store rhopaloids.

AB  - Spores of five Laminariales from Arctic Spitsbergen were exposed in the laboratory to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm), PAR + UVA radiation (UVAR; 320-400 nm) and PAR + UVAR + UVB radiation (UVBR; 280-320 nm). Subsequently, germination was monitored over periods of 3, 6 and 9 days. The investigated species were the upper sublittoral Saccorhiza dermatodea, the upper to mid-sublittoral Alaria esculenta and Laminaria digitata, the mid-sublittoral L. saccharina and the lower sublittoral L. solidungula. The germination capacity decreased sharply after 16 h exposure to PAR + - UVAR + UVBR in all species. However, S. dermatodea was able to recover from the damaging effects of UVBR. There was also a small increase in percentage germination of A. esculenta 6-9 days after the treatment. No recovery was evident in the other species. After 8 h exposure to PAR + UVA + UVB, L. digitata recovered completely, and L. saccharina and L. solidungula, partially. The only species susceptible to PAR + UVAR was L. solidungula. One prominent cytological feature of UVR-exposed spores was the enlargement of phenolic vesicles (physodes) (particularly seen in S. dermatodea and A. esculenta), which may have a protective function against UVR. Pilot experiments under natural irradiance conditions indicate that the PAR component of solar radiation exerts an additional stress. Overall the data show that zoospores of the species from the upper sublittoral are less sensitive to UVR or have the capacity to recover from UV stress in contrast to species from deeper waters, probably due to their UV protective and repair capabilities. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - A production technique for single cell detritus (SCD) from Laminaria saccharina (L.) Lamouroux was developed based on the sequential action of two enzymes, endoglucanases and cellulases, and two bacteria isolated in our laboratories: CECT-5255 and CECT-5256, which have high levels of cellobiosic, proteolytic and alginolytic activity. Using this technique, L. saccharina meal is transformed into a suspension of algal cells and detritus of Less than 20 m in diameter, which can easily be filtered and digested by bivalve molluscs. A feeding trial carried out with Ruditapes decussatus (L., 1758) seed clams showed that L. saccharina SCD, when used as their sole diet, got 40 % of the seed growth achieved with a microalgal diet (control diet). When the SCD was used in a mixed diet, it could substitute up to 90 % of the microalgae, with comparable or even higher growth rates than exclusive microalgal diets.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to see the applicability of using brown edible seaweeds as a sole source of nutrition for the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Growth kinetics of lactic acid bacteria (LAB; Lactobacillus plantarum) was studied using three species of edible Irish brown seaweeds Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina. As part of the screening process, growth of the LAB was carried out on raw and heat treated forms of seaweeds. The seaweed species in their raw state could not support the growth of L. plantarum. Heat treatment resulted in almost 4 times increase in the total sugar content in L. digitata and L. saccharina broth which allowed the growth of L. plantarum for 24 h after which the cell number started decreasing. The Laminaria spp. contains a high content of laminaran polysaccharide which can be fermented by LAB. In case of H. elongata, neither raw nor heat treated forms could be fermented; even though the total sugar content increased 4.6 times upon the application of heat. Kinetics of cell growth, lactic acid and acetic acid production was evaluated at different agitation rates in heat treated seaweeds. A maximum log CFU/ml of 10 was achieved at the end of 16-24 h of fermentation for L. saccharina and L. digitata, respectively. The cell growth increased and lactic acid accumulation decreased as the agitation speed was increased from 0 to 100 rpm. Maximum lactic acid accumulation of 2.5 g/l was achieved under static (0 rpm) conditions. The production of acetic acid was very minimal during the entire course of fermentation. Experimental data was mathematically modelled to optimize the cell growth and lactic acid production with respect to the different rotation conditions. The results of this study present an indication of the potential of fermentation of seaweeds using LAB with a possibility towards the development of a range of functional foods. © 2010 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The fauna, associated with Laminaria and other large brown macroalgae was studied by using SCUBA and dredging in two different types of underwater habitats of the White Sea. In shallow water fjords and bays, with a depth of no more than 30-40 m, detached kelp (mainly Laminaria saccharina, L. digitata and Alaria esculenta) formed large accumulations. One of these benthic accumulations, which has existed more than 20 years, was studied. It covers about 2000 m2, and is about 2 m thick. The upper layer of the accumulation of fronds is characterized by high turbulence and is well aerated. The lower layer is characterized by anoxic conditions. Mats of sulphur bacteria were not observed, although fronds in the middle layer were covered by layers of cyanobacteria. About 50 species of macroinvertebrates were found, mainly species that are normally associated with living kelp, such as the detritivorous species Ophiura robusta and Gammarus oceanicus, and few species that are specific inhabitants of organic-rich biotopes in the White Sea such as Capitella capitata, Ophryotrocha irinae and Nebalia bipes. It was remarkable that in the shallow water basins of the White Sea, the process of decomposition of brown algae in the sublittoral takes place without sea urchins, and no other macrofaunal form plays an ecological role in the mechanical breakdown of the plant substratum, even not in the large accumulations of detached kelp. Along the open rocky shoreline, communities associated with dead detached kelp were situated at a depth of 60-90 m, 40-50 m below the belt of living kelp. In this deep zone, no macroinvertebrates typical of the kelp community in the photic zone were found. During the passage from the shoreline to the deeper benthic community, where sea urchins were dominant, all plant debris became fragmented. These deeper benthic communities appeared to be the zone for decomposition of the detached kelp.

AB  - The germination of spores of the endophytic brown algae Laminariocolax aecidioides and Laminarionema elsbetiae (Ectocarpales sensu lato) on their host Laminaria saccharina was studied using scanning electron microscopy. Zoids were the infective units in both taxa. Despite a large difference in size between spores of the species studied, the initial steps of infection were similar. Zoids settled on the host surface, and during secretion of adhesive material from their anterior end, the spores became elongated to rod-shaped and stood erect on the host. A single germ tube developed at the proximal end and penetrated the intact surface of the host. Sharp edges around the entrance hole and the absence of inward deformation of the host surface around the settled zoids suggest an enzymatic rather than a mechanical penetration mechanism.

AB  - Microbial digestion was carried out using three species of brown algae, Laminaria hyperborea (Gunn.) Foslie, L. saccharina (L.) Lamour, and Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol, harvested from the Norwegian coast. Anaerobic digestion of these algae was investigated in a series of benchscale experiments in batch and semicontinuous cultures. The experiments included investigations on loading rate, retention time, gas yield and corresponding changes in total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS). The specific gas production from the two Laminaria species was almost double that obtained from A. nodosum. Retention times of 8-16 days gave the highest daily gas production, about 1ß-2 times the reactor volume per day. By controlling the loading rate carefully the digestion process could be run without addition of alkali and still maintain the pH above 7. Retention times of less than 8 days gave a partially digested material with binding properties which was tested as an additive to peat briquettes suitable for seeding and production of plantlets. Retention times of 16-24 days resulted in extensive degradation of organic polymeric material that yielded a water soluble extract after filtration and evaporation. This material was tested as a fertilizer on lettuce, including application as a foliar spray. © 1987.

AB  - The fauna associated with sea-bed accumulations of decomposing Laminaria saccharina has been studied by year-round SCUBA diving at two sites in the Clyde Sea area. Seasonal changes in density of 64 species are reported. In the autumn, large quantities of kelp are detached by storms. This weed carries with it to the sea bed a large part of its normal fauna. Additional species settle onto the weed from the plankton whilst others migrate onto it from the surrounding sea bed. Peak densities of associated species were recorded in autumn. Litter bag experiments in situ showed that, except during the summer, weed is lost from sea-bed accumulations at a faster rate when macrofaunal animals are excluded. The macrofauna therefore inhibits decomposition. The relative importance of interactive cropping by three macrodetritivores, Psammechinus miliaris (Echinodermata), Platynereis dumerilii (Polychaeta) and Gammarus locusta (Amphipoda) was studied by in situ containment of different species combinations. The presence of Gammarus with Psammechinus resulted in less weed being lost than when Psammechinus was isolated. This is because Gammarus selectively crops rotting weed, retarding frond disintegration by microbes. Platynereis retards microbial colonization of frond tissues ruptured during its feeding by repeated cropping of the same region. Weed would decompose very rapidly were it not for macrofaunal cropping. Macroalgal decay thus differs profoundly from that of vascular plants. © 1984.

AB  - Psammechinus miliaris occurs in the Clyde Sea area in large numbers (<18 individuals per 100 g-1 weed dry wt) on sublittoral beds of detached Laminaria saccharina. Its rôle in weed decomposition has been examined by comparing its responses (behavioural choice, growth rate, absorption efficiencies of both carbon and protein, gut retention times and rate of faecal output) to fresh and rotting weed. Younger urchins grew faster than older individuals on a diet of rotting weed but not on fresh weed. Large seasonal variation existed, however, with fast growth occurring in June-August and little, or no, growth in December-February, irrespective of diet. Starved controls did not grow. Correcting for seasonality, rotting kelp still promoted faster growth of young urchins than did fresh weed. Larger (older) individuals showed no difference. Urchins fed fresh weed had significantly longer gut retention times. Protein absorption efficiency was higher on fresh than rotting weed, varying with weed protein content and size of urchin. Very young individuals can only digest high protein weed efficiently, eg. material derived from near the frond meristem. Organic carbon content of rotting weed was significantly lower than fresh weed. Carbon absorption efficiencies were significantly higher on fresh weed which related to organic carbon content. Standard-sized urchins fed rotting weed produced larger dry weights of faeces per day, reflecting increased ingestion rate. In closed-system choice experiments urchins preferred rotting weed kinetically. Size-frequency analysis of field populations suggested that weed beds are principally colonized by larval settlement from the plankton. Mature Psammechinus have evolved different 'strategies' for exploiting fresh and rotting weed. Fresh weed is relatively difficult to digest and long gut retention times allow high protein absorption efficiencies to be attained. Rotting weed has microbial protein in quantities and a lower organic carbon fraction. Some bacterial protein is seemingly unavailable though and lower protein absorption efficiencies result. Thus gut retention time is shortened and more food passed through the gut. Growth remains equivalent. Substratum digestion is of paramount importance for Psammechinus feeding on either fresh or rotting weed, cf. the 'classical' microbe-stripping detritivore of Fenchel. © 1985.

AB  - The abundance of Aurelia and Cyanea scyphopolyps on Laminaria saccharina was higher in sheltered, shallow areas compared with more exposed or deep ones. Liberated planulae probably were not transported far away from stranded and trapped jellyfish and settled nearby, preferably in patches on the downward side of the Laminaria thallus. The principal prey for the scyphopolyps seems to be small copepods and the cladocerans Podon sp. and Evadne sp., which are abundant in surface waters during the summer. Temporarily abundant planktonic organisms, e.g., Sagitta setosa, Pleurobrachia pileus and hydromedusae might, also be important prey. Harpacticids, halacarideans and Corophium sp., whose natural habitat is on L. saccharina, were not captured by the scyphopolyps. Scyphopolyps cultured in running sea water rich in detritus and phytoplankton fill their enteron with organic substrates, particularly diatoms. A new category of heterotrichous microbasic rhopaloid nematocysts was identified in the scyphopolyps. These rhopaloids were earlier included within the euryteles and were not considered to be separate nematocysts. They are distinctive from the euryteles due to the two swellings on their discharged shaft. The absence or presence of the nudibranch Coryphella verrucosa on laminarian thalli possibly has an effect on the number of scyphopolyps, as this nudibranch consumes numerous scyphopolyps. Isorhizas and the new category of rhopaloid nematocysts, identical to those present in the Aurelia polyps, occurred in the cnidosacs of examined C. verrucosa. The proportion of rhopaloid nematocysts compared with a-isorhizas was noticeably higher in C. verrucosa than in scyphopolyps. The nudibranch may selectively store rhopaloids.

AB  - This study analyses the food value for bivalve mollusc seed of single cell detritus (SCD) from Laminaria saccharina, produced in accordance with the technique developed by Pérez Camacho et al. [Pérez Camacho, A., Salinas, J.M., Fuertes, C., Delgado, M., 2005. Preparation of single cell detritus from L. saccharina as a hatchery diet for bivalve mollusks. Mar. Biotechnol. 6, 642-649], which is based on the sequential action of two enzymes: endoglucanases and cellulases and two bacteria isolated in our laboratories: CECT 5255 and CECT 5256, which have high cellobiosic, proteolytic and alginolytic activities. Using this technique, L. saccharina meal is transformed in a suspension of algal cells and detritus of less than 20 μm in diameter, which can easily be filtered and digested by the bivalve molluscs. SCD from L. saccharina can replace between 80% and 90% of the live phytoplankton content in the feeding of R. decussatus, with growth rates equalling, and even surpassing, those resulting from live phytoplankton diets. If we then factor in the low sedimentation of this product, the lack of proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the culture vessels (possibly as a consequence of the control exercised by the bacteria used in the SCE production process), and the high survival rates of the individuals used in our experiments, we can well conclude that SCD from L. saccharina is an effective complement to live phytoplankton diets for R. decussatus, its use reducing the need to produce phytoplankton in industrial bivalve mollusc hatcheries by up to 90%. Similarly, the introduction of this food would also appreciably diminish operating costs in this kind of industry, where phytoplankton culture accounts for some 30% of total production costs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bacteria associated with the marine macroalga Laminaria saccharina, collected from the Kiel Fjord (Baltic Sea, Germany), were isolated and tested for antimicrobial activity. From a total of 210 isolates, 103 strains inhibited the growth of at least one microorganism from the test panel including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as a yeast. Most common profiles were the inhibition of Bacillus subtilis only (30%), B. subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus (25%), and B. subtilis, S. lentus, and Candida albicans (11%). In summary, the antibiotic-active isolates covered 15 different activity patterns suggesting various modes of action. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities >99%, 45 phylotypes were defined, which were classified into 21 genera belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that four isolates possibly represent novel species or even genera. In conclusion, L. saccharina represents a promising source for the isolation of new bacterial taxa and antimicrobially active bacteria. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The sporogenic tissue, motile zoospores and non-motile embryospores of Laminaria saccharina were exposed to the different levels of the ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) (0.1-1.2 W m-2) over 12-24 h. At an irradiance of 1.2 W m-2 spore release began after 4 h exposure of the sporogenic tissue to UV-B. There were also many non-motile spores and the fragments of damaged sporangia found in the media. The motile zoospores ceased their movement after their treatment with UV-B of 1.2 W m-2 for 8-10 h, although they retained their viability. The embryospores did not survive after 24 h exposure at an irradiance of higher than 0.6 W m-2. Tolerance to UV-B attenuated in the following sequence: spores within the sporogenic tissue - motile zoospores - embryospores. Our results strongly suggest that UV-B effectively controls spore release, germination and further development of the early ontogenic stages of Laminaria saccharina.

AB  - Seasonal reproduction in some Arctic Laminariales coincides with increased UV-B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion and relatively high water temperatures during polar spring. To find out the capacity to cope with different spectral irradiance, the kinetics of photosynthetic recovery was investigated in zoospores of four Arctic species of the order Laminariales, the kelps Saccorhiza dermatodea, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, and Laminaria saccharina. The physiology of light harvesting, changes in photosynthetic efficiency and kinetics of photosynthetic recovery were measured by in vivo fluorescence changes of Photosystem II (PSII). Saturation irradiance of freshly released spores showed minimal I k values (photon fluence rate where initial slope intersects horizontal asymptote of the curve) values ranging from 13 to 18 μmol photons m-2 s-1 among species collected at different depths, confirming that spores are low-light adapted. Exposure to different radiation spectra consisting of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm), PAR+UV-A radiation (UV-A; 320-400 nm), and PAR+ UV-A+UV-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) showed that the cumulative effects of increasing PAR fluence and the additional effect of UV-A and UV-B radiations on photoinhibition of photosynthesis are species specific. After long exposures, Laminaria saccharina was more sensitive to the different light treatments than the other three species investigated. Kinetics of recovery in zoospores showed a fast phase in S. dermatodea, which indicates a reduction of the photoprotective process while a slow phase in L. saccharina indicates recovery from severe photodamage. This first attempt to study photoinhibition and kinetics of recovery in zoospores showed that zoospores are the stage in the life history of seaweeds most susceptible to light stress and that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) effectively delays photosynthetic recovery. The viability of spores is important on the recruitment of the gametophytic and sporophytic life stages. The impact of UVR on the zoospores is related to the vertical depth distribution of the large sporophytes in the field. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.

AB  - A novel alphaproteobacterium, strain LD81T, was isolated from the marine macroalga Laminaria saccharina. The bacterium is mesophilic and shows a typical marine growth response. It is a chemoheterotrophic aerobe with the potential for denitrification. Growth optima are 25 °C, pH 5.5 and 3% NaCl. Strain LD81T has a unique phylogenetic position, not fitting any of the known families of the Alphaproteobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed a distant relationship to species of several orders of the Alphaproteobacteria, with less than 90% sequence similarity. Phylogenetically, strain LD81T is related to the type strains of Terasakiella pusilla (88.4% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and the three Thalassospira species (88.9-89.2 %). It forms a cluster with these bacteria and a novel as-yet undescribed isolate (KOPRI 13522; 96.6% sequence similarity). Strain LD81T has a relatively low DNA G+C content (51.1 mol%) and, due to its distant phylogenetic position from all other alphaproteobacteria, strain LD81T (=NCIMB 14374T =JCM 14845T) is considered as the type strain of a novel species within a new genus, for which the name Kiloniella laminariae gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The genus Kiloniella represents the type of the new family Kiloniellaceae fam. nov. and order Kiloniellales ord. nov. © 2009 IUMS.

AB  - Depth distribution of kelp species in Helgoland (North Sea) is characterized by occurrence of Laminaria digitata in the upper sublittoral, whereas L. saccharina and L. hyperborea dominate the mid and lower sublittoral region. Laminaria digitata is fertile in summer whereas both other species are fertile in autumn/winter. To determine the light sensitivity of the propagules, zoospores of L. digitata, L. saccharina and L. hyperborea were exposed in the laboratory to different exposure times of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm), PAR + UVA radiation (UVAR; 320-400 nm) and PAR + UVAR + UVB radiation (UVBR; 280-320 nm). Optimum quantum yield of PSII and DNA damage were measured after exposure. Subsequently, recovery of photosynthetic efficiency and DNA damage repair, as well as germination rate were measured after 2 and 3 d cultivation in dim white light. Photosynthetic efficiency of all species was photoinhibited already at 20 μmol photons m-2 s-1 PAR, whereas UV radiation (UVR) had a significant additional effect on photoinhibition. Recovery of the PSII function was observed in all species but not in spores exposed to irradiation longer than 4 h of PAR + UVA + UVB and 8 h of PAR + UVA. The amount of UVB-induced DNA damage measured as cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) increased with exposure time and highest damage was detected in the spores of lower subtidal L. hyperborea relative to the other two species. Significant removal of CPDs indicating repair of DNA damage was observed in all species after 2 d in low white light especially in the spores of upper subtidal L. digitata. Therefore, efficient DNA damage repair and recovery of PSII damage contributed to the germination success but not in spores exposed to 16 h of UVBR. UV absorption of zoospore suspension in L. digitata is based both on the absorption by the zoospores itself as well as by exudates in the medium. In contrast, the absorption of the zoospore suspension in L. saccharina and L. hyperborea is based predominantly on the absorption by the exudates in the medium. This study indicates that UVR sensitivity of zoospores is related to the seasonal zoospore production as well as the vertical distribution pattern of the large sporophytes. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Spores and gametophytes are considered to be those life-history stages of kelps most susceptible to environmental perturbations and, in particular, to temperature and UV radiation. Microstages of Arctic (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, Alaria esculenta from Spitsbergen) and temperate kelp species (S. latissima, L. digitata, L. hyperborea from the North Sea) were exposed in 2-factorial experiments to different temperatures (2 to 18°C) and radiation conditions (photosynthetic active radiation, UV-A radiation, UV-B radiation). Our results reveal ecotypic differentiations in the stress responses of zoospores of L. digitata and S. latissima from the Arctic and North Sea. UV-A radiation either enhanced the formation of gametes at elevated temperatures in L. digitata or impaired egg release and subsequent sporophyte formation in L. hyperborea. Microstages exposed to additional UV-B radiation were strongly inhibited to a population-, species- and life phase-specific degree at suboptimal and optimal temperatures. Only gametogenesis of Laminaria spp. was shown to be tolerant to UV-B exposure. Conclusively, in respect to a future scenario of elevated UV radiation regimes and higher summer temperatures in Arctic and North Sea waters, summer-recruiting Arctic species and L. digitata from the North Sea might become endangered by a frequent disturbance of their microstages. © Inter-Research 2008.

AB  - Six species of edible Irish seaweeds; Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, Himanthalia elongata, Palmaria palmata, Chondrus crispus and Enteromorpha spirulina were screened for potential bioactivity. Extraction of secondary metabolites was carried out using different solvents to determine antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the dried extracts. The total phenolic contents of dried methanolic extracts were significantly different (p < 0.05). H. elongata exhibited highest phenolic content at 151.3 mg GAE/g of seaweed extract and also had the highest DPPH scavenging activity (p < 0.05) with a 50% inhibition (EC50) level at 0.125μg/ml of extract. H. elongata also had the highest total tannin and total flavonoid contents (p < 0.05) of 38.34 mg CE/g and 42.5 mg QE/g, respectively. Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microtitre method which allowed detection of bacterial growth inhibition at low levels. All methanolic seaweed extracts inhibited the food spoilage and food pathogenic bacteria tested; Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella abony, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, except C. crispus extracts. It was found that dried methanolic extracts of red and green seaweeds had significantly lower antimicrobial activity than the brown species; H. elongata had the highest antimicrobial activity with up to 100% inhibition. In the studied work, the antimicrobial activity of red and green seaweed extracts significantly increased when ethanol and acetone were used as extraction solvents (p < 0.05). Inhibition of E. faecalis with C. crispus extracts increased from 39.28 to 100% when ethanol and acetone were applied as solvents.

AB  - Dynamena pumila (L.) lives on the brown alga Laminaria saccharina and Fucus serratus, in areas exposed to waves and currents. An experimental study of settling behaviour and metamorphosis of the planulae was conducted. Reconstruction of larval settlement showed that the colonies of D. pumila developed and fed in high flow environments, due not only to various adaptations of their morphology, but in great extent, due to the specific behaviour of larvae at, and prior to settlement and metamorphosis. Positive phototaxis by newly liberated planulae of D. pumila leads to colonization of illuminated zones on fucoid thalli and laminarian stipes and blades, where they metamorphosed in response to microbial films covering the algal surface. Crawling planulae of D. pumila were far more resistant to rapid water flows than the planulae of other hydroids, what allows this hydroid to establish its colonies in places with strong water movements, where the other species could not develop. Temporary exposure to air facilitated attachment and metamorphosis of the planulae, which probably settle and undergo metamorphosis during the periods of low-tidal emersion.

AB  - Rates of macroalgal carbon monoxide (CO) production were compared among 5 taxa representing 3 major phylogenetic groups (Phaeophyta, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta). CO production varied substantially from a minimum of about 20 ng CO gdw-1 h-1 for Fucus vesiculosus to > 4000 ng CO gdw-1 h-1 for Laminaria saccharina. None of the macroalgae examined contained significantly elevated CO concentrations within their pneumatocysts (float bladders), so the variability among taxa reflects other intrinsic properties. An in vitro evaluation of Ascophyllum nodosum indicated that CO production varied as a function of temperature, desiccation and illumination. CO production increased strongly for live fronds over an ecologically relevant range (5 to 23°C), but decreased at 45°C. For non-living desiccated wrack, CO production increased consistently from 5 to 47°C. Short-term desiccation of living algae decreased CO production substantially, but long-term changes in water content appeared not to markedly alter CO production relative to fresh material. Illumination strongly increased CO production relative to dark incubations, with similar responses for living and non-living material. CO oxidation (presumably bacterial) was observed for most living algae during incubations with exogenous CO at concentrations of 100 ppm, suggesting that a microbe-alga association might limit in part CO fluxes. Extrapolation of CO production rates indicates that macroalgae likely contribute only a minor fraction (<1%) of global marine CO emissions to the atmosphere (about 10 Tg yr-1).

AB  - From 1999 to 2005, studies carried out in the frame of regional and national French programs aimed to determine whether the Phaeocystis globosa bloom affected the intertidal benthic communities of the French coast of the eastern English Channel in terms of composition and/or functioning. Study sites were chosen to cover most of the typical shore types encountered on this coast (a rocky shore, an exposed sandy beach and a small estuary). Both the presence of active Phaeocystis cells and their degradation product (foam) did have a significant impact on the studied shores. The primary production and growth rates of the kelp Saccharina latissima decreased during the bloom because of a shortage of light and nutrient for the macroalgae. On sandy sediments, the benthic metabolism (community respiration and community primary production), as well as the nitrification rate, were enhanced during foam deposits, in relation with the presence of bacteria and active pelagic cells within the decaying colonies. In estuarine sediments, the most impressive impact was the formation of a crust at the sediment surface due to drying foam. This led to anoxic conditions in the surface sediment and resulted in a high mortality among the benthic community. Some organisms also tended to migrate upward and were then directly accessible to the higher trophic level represented by birds. Phaeocystis then created a shortcut in the estuarine trophic network. Most of these modifications lasted shortly and all the systems considered came back to their regular properties and activities a few weeks after the end of the bloom, except for the most impacted estuarine area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Resonance Raman spectroscopy of an antenna protein from the brown alga Laminaria saccharina has been used to investigate the molecular structure of this light-harvesting complex (LHC) at the level of its bound pigments, chiorophylls (chl) a and c and the xanthophyll fucoxanthin. Evidence has been obtained for the conservation of pigment structure during the isolation procedure used. Six chl a and two chl c molecules are indicated from the positions and relative contributions of stretching modes of their keto- carbonyl groups. Of special interest is the presence of a population of chls a having a protein-binding conformation highly similar to that seen in antenna proteins from higher plants, possibly indicating a common structural motif within this extended gene family. The eight fucoxanthin molecules evidenced are all in the all-trans conformation; however, one or two have a highly twisted configuration. The results are discussed in terms of common and varying structural features of LHCs in higher plants and algae.
