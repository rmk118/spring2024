AB  - Bacteria associated with the marine macroalga Laminaria saccharina, collected from the Kiel Fjord (Baltic Sea, Germany), were isolated and tested for antimicrobial activity. From a total of 210 isolates, 103 strains inhibited the growth of at least one microorganism from the test panel including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as a yeast. Most common profiles were the inhibition of Bacillus subtilis only (30%), B. subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus (25%), and B. subtilis, S. lentus, and Candida albicans (11%). In summary, the antibiotic-active isolates covered 15 different activity patterns suggesting various modes of action. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities >99%, 45 phylotypes were defined, which were classified into 21 genera belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that four isolates possibly represent novel species or even genera. In conclusion, L. saccharina represents a promising source for the isolation of new bacterial taxa and antimicrobially active bacteria.

AB  - IntroductionSaccharina latissima is a canopy-forming species of brown algae and, as such, is considered an ecosystem engineer. Several populations of this alga are exploited worldwide, and a decrease in the abundance of S. latissima at its southern distributional range limits has been observed. Despite its economic and ecological interest, only a few data are available on the composition of microbiota associated with S. latissima and its role in algal physiologyn.MethodsWe studied the whole bacterial community composition associated with S. latissima samples from three locations (Brittany, Helgoland, and Skagerrak) by 16S metabarcoding analyses at different scales: algal blade part, regions, season (at one site), and algal physiologic state.Results and DiscussionWe have shown that the difference in bacterial composition is driven by factors of decreasing importance: (i) the algal tissues (apex/meristem), (ii) the geographical area, (iii) the seasons (at the Roscoff site), and (iv) the algal host’s condition (healthy vs. symptoms). Overall, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia dominated the general bacterial communities. Almost all individuals hosted bacteria of the genus Granulosicoccus, accounting for 12% of the total sequences, and eight additional core genera were identified. Our results also highlight a microbial signature characteristic for algae in poor health independent of the disease symptoms. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the S. latissima microbiome, forming a basis for understanding holobiont functioning.

AB  - The sugar kelp Saccharina latissima dominates many temperate coastal ecosystems, plays key ecological roles and presents important economic potential. However, its microbiota remains poorly investigated, although it could play an important role in algal fitness. In this study, we combined high throughput Illumina-based DNA sequencing and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization to perform a culture-independent investigation of the S. latissima bacterial and fungal microbiota. Up to 600 bacterial and 100 fungal Amplicon Sequence Variants were identified per algal individual, revealing diverse bacterial and fungal communities associated to S. latissima. Overall, bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, in particular Hyphomonadaceae and Cyclobacteriaceae. Fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, in particular Mycosphaerellaceae, Psathyrellaceae, and Bulleribasidiaceae. Our results also revealed a variable distribution of S. latissima microbiota, as two adjacent tissue samples typically contained distinct fungal and bacterial assemblages, and CARD-FISH analysis detected microbial endosymbionts (with a few epibionts). Complementary analyses showed that despite achieving a good sequencing coverage for each tissue sample, the unexpected diversity and variability of ASVs made the definition of a core fungal and bacterial microbiota difficult, and highlights novel avenues to overcome the limitations of current surface-sterilization and metabarcoding protocols.

AB  - Seasonal variations of the cell density and bacterial community composition in biofilms growing on the surface of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea from 2 sites on the southwestern coast of Norway were investigated using total cell enumeration and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. The major taxonomical groups of bacteria inhabiting the biofilms were identified by DGGE band sequence classification. The microbial cell density of the biofilm appeared to be highly affected by the seasonal growth cycle of the kelp and was found to be lowest on growing kelp in March (minimum 8.3 × 102 cells cm–2), while on non-growing kelp in July to February, it was around 1.0 × 107 cells cm–2 with large fluctuations. The composition of the bacterial community of the biofilm followed a continuous seasonal succession that may be explained by the influence of both biotic factors such as seasonal changes in the kelp substrate and abiotic factors such as seawater temperature. Planctomycetes and Alphaproteobacteria were frequently detected throughout the year, while Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were more sporadically detected. The bacterial communities of the biofilm on kelp showed little overlap with that of the surrounding seawater.

AB  - Epibacterial communities on thalli of the algal species Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, Laminaria saccharina, Ulva compressa, Delesseria sanguinea and Phycodrys rubens were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based DGGE. Individuals of all species were collected in the Kiel Fjord (Baltic Sea) and in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland (North Sea). DGGE gels as well as cluster and multidimensional scaling analysis based on the DGGE band patterns of the epibacterial community showed significant differences between the epibacterial communities on the investigated algal species both in the Baltic and North Seas. Epibacterial communities differed less between regions than between host species, and were more similar on closely related host species. Results give the first evidence for lineage-specific bacterial associations to algal thalli. Furthermore, the results suggest that these algal species may control their epibiotic bacterial communities.

AB  - Seaweeds (macroalgae) form a diverse and ubiquitous group of photosynthetic organisms that play an essential role in aquatic ecosystems. These ecosystem engineers contribute significantly to global primary production and are the major habitat formers on rocky shores in temperate waters, providing food and shelter for aquatic life. Like other eukaryotic organisms, macroalgae harbor a rich diversity of associated microorganisms with functions related to host health and defense. In particular, epiphytic bacterial communities have been reported as essential for normal morphological development of the algal host, and bacteria with antifouling properties are thought to protect chemically undefended macroalgae from detrimental, secondary colonization by other microscopic and macroscopic epibiota. This tight relationship suggests that macroalgae and epiphytic bacteria interact as a unified functional entity or holobiont, analogous to the previously suggested relationship in corals. Moreover, given that the impact of diseases in marine ecosystems is apparently increasing, understanding the role of bacteria as saprophytes and pathogens in seaweed communities may have important implications for marine management strategies. This review reports on the recent advances in the understanding of macroalgal–bacterial interactions with reference to the diversity and functional role of epiphytic bacteria in maintaining algal health, highlighting the holobiont concept.

AB  - Macroalgae are photosynthetic, multicellular, sessile eukaryotic organisms that offer diverse habitats for the colonization of epiphytic bacteria, therefore establishing biological interactions of diverse complexity. This review focusses on the interactions between macroalgae and their Epiphytic Bacterial Community (EBC); the main aims are to ascertain whether (1) the epiphytic bacterial groups differ at the phylum and genus levels of the macroalgae; (2) the methodologies used so far to study these microorganisms are related in any way to eventual variations of the EBCs on macroalgae; and (3) the EBC of macroalgae has a functional means rather a simple taxonomic grouping. Results showed firstly the taxonomic grouping of macroalgae does not explain the composition and structure of the EBCs. Secondly, the methodology used is important for describing EBCs; and thirdly, multiple bacteria can have the same function and thus to describe the functionality of EBCs it is important to recognize host-specific and generalist bacteria. We recommend the incorporation of a complementary approach between the taxonomic composition and the functional composition analyzes of EBCs, as well as the use of methodological tools that allow analysis of interactions between the EBCs and their hosts, based on the “holobiont” concept.

AB  - Sugar kelp cultivation at the southern end of its range on the east coast of North America is being pursued commercially for human consumption, which demands a high-quality product. Blade quality can be compromised by attached organisms – epibionts. Biweekly examination of epibionts on sugar kelp was conducted April–May 2018, on a kelp farm in eastern Long Island Sound, CT, USA. Culturable Vibrio spp. were not present on kelp blades until May and were limited to only old sections. No Vibrio colonies were human pathogens V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus, based upon ToxR-specific multiplex PCR assays. Neither epibenthic cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. nor the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, microbes of concern because of toxigenicity, were detected on kelp by microscopy or metabarcoding of partial rRNA genes. The lacy bryozoan was the only epibiotic animal observed that could cause damage to kelp, but its abundance was low. Summarizing most-common sequence reads, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial group on kelp blades (49%) and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant in seawater (39%). Bacillariophyta were the most abundant eukaryotes on kelp blades (36%) and Dinoflagellata were the most abundant eukaryotes in seawater (43%). Molecular operational taxonomic unit matrices were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling; the most prominent structure for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities was the separation between blade and seawater samples. This spatial separation explained 81% and 76% of the variation among prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, respectively. Indicator Species Analysis identified Gammaproteobacteria (55%) and Bacillariophyta (56%) to be the most important blade indicator prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. A closer examination of indicator species temporal patterns and their ecophysiology suggested that Aquimarina, Parcubacteria, and Peronosporomycetes are potential pathogens to sugar kelp. Ciliates may be the most important grazers that keep epiphytes (Bacillariophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta) and Peronosporomycetes on kelp in check.

TI  - Microbial “gardening” by a seaweed holobiont: Surface metabolites attract protective and deter pathogenic epibacterial settlement
AU  - Saha, Mahasweta
AU  - Weinberger, Florian
T2  - Journal of Ecology
AB  - Epimicrobial communities on seaweed surfaces usually contain not only potentially pathogenic but also potentially beneficial micro-organisms. Capacity of terrestrial plants for chemically mediated recruitment, that is, “gardening” of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere was recently demonstrated. Empirical evidence directly linking such chemical “gardening” with the beneficial role of gardened microbes in terrestrial plants is rare and largely missing for aquatic macrophytes. Here, we demonstrate that our model invasive seaweed holobiont Agarophyton vermiculophyllum possesses beneficial microbiota on its surface that provide protection from bacterial pathogens. Metabolites from the algal holobiont’s surface reduced settlement of opportunistic pathogens but attracted protective epibacterial settlement. We tested 58 different bacterial species (isolated from the surface of A. vermiculophyllum) individually in tip bleaching assays. Kordia algicida was identified as a “significant pathogen” inducing a bleaching disease. In addition, nine other species significantly reduced the risk of algal bleaching and were thus “significantly protective”. Additionally, two “potential pathogens” and 10 “potential protectors” were identified. When 19 significant and potential protectors and 3 significant and potential pathogens were tested together, the protective strains fully prevented bleaching, suggesting that a component of A. vermiculophyllum’s epimicrobiome provides an associational defence against pathogens. Chemically mediated selective recruitment of microbes was demonstrated in bioassays, where A. vermiculophyllum surface metabolites attracted the settlement of protective strains, but reduced settlement of pathogens. Synthesis. The capacity of an aquatic macrophyte to chemically “garden” protective micro-organisms to the benefit of strengthened disease resistance is demonstrated for the first time. Such a role of surface chemistry in “gardening” of microbes as found in the current study could also be applicable to other host plant—microbe interactions. Our results may open new avenues towards manipulation of the surface microbiome of seaweeds via chemical “gardening,” enhancing sustainable production of healthy seaweeds.

AB  - Kelp forest ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots, providing habitat for dense assemblages of marine organisms and nutrients for marine and terrestrial food webs. The surfaces of kelps support diverse microbial communities that facilitate the transfer of carbon from algal primary production to higher trophic levels. We quantified the diversity of bacteria on the surfaces of eight sympatric kelp species from four sites in British Columbia. Kelp-associated bacterial communities are significantly different from their environment, even though 86% of their bacterial taxa are shared with seawater and 97% are shared with rocky substrate. This differentiation is driven by differences in relative abundance of the bacterial taxa present. Similarly, a large portion of bacterial taxa (37%) is shared among all eight kelp species, yet differential abundance of bacterial taxa underlies differences in community structure among species. Kelp-associated bacterial diversity does not track host phylogeny; instead bacterial community composition is correlated with the life-history strategy of the host, with annual and perennial kelps supporting divergent bacterial communities. These data provide the first community-scale investigation of kelp forest-associated bacterial diversity. More broadly, this study provides insight into mechanisms that may structure bacterial communities among closely related sympatric host species.

AB  - Our understanding of diseases has been transformed by the realisation that people are holobionts, comprised of a host and its associated microbiome(s). Disease can also have devastating effects on populations of marine organisms, including dominant habitat formers such as seaweed holobionts. However, we know very little about how interactions between microorganisms within microbiomes - of humans or marine organisms – affect host health and there is no underpinning theoretical framework for exploring this. We applied ecological models of succession to bacterial communities to understand how interactions within a seaweed microbiome affect the host. We observed succession of surface microbiomes on the red seaweed Delisea pulchra in situ, following a disturbance, with communities ‘recovering’ to resemble undisturbed states after only 12 days. Further, if this recovery was perturbed, a bleaching disease previously described for this seaweed developed. Early successional strains of bacteria protected the host from colonisation by a pathogenic, later successional strain. Host chemical defences also prevented disease, such that within-microbiome interactions were most important when the host’s chemical defences were inhibited. This is the first experimental evidence that interactions within microbiomes have important implications for host health and disease in a dominant marine habitat-forming organism.

AB  - Elucidating the spatial structure of host-associated microbial communities is essential for understanding taxon-taxon interactions within the microbiota and between microbiota and host. Macroalgae are colonized by complex microbial communities, suggesting intimate symbioses that likely play key roles in both macroalgal and bacterial biology, yet little is known about the spatial organization of microbes associated with macroalgae. Canopy-forming kelp are ecologically significant, fixing teragrams of carbon per year in coastal kelp forest ecosystems. We characterized the micron-scale spatial organization of bacterial communities on blades of the kelp Nereocystis luetkeana using fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging with a probe set combining phylum-, class-, and genus-level probes to localize and identify > 90% of the microbial community.

AB  - Interactions between hosts and their microbiota are vital to the functioning and resilience of macro-organisms. Critically, for hosts that play foundational roles in communities, understanding what drives host–microbiota interactions is essential for informing ecosystem restoration and conservation. We investigated the relative influence of host traits and the surrounding environment on microbial communities associated with the foundational seaweed Phyllospora comosa. We quantified 16 morphological and functional phenotypic traits, including host genetics (using 354 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and surface-associated microbial communities (using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) from 160 individuals sampled from eight sites spanning Phyllospora's entire latitudinal distribution (1,300 km). Combined, these factors explained 54% of the overall variation in Phyllospora's associated microbial community structure, much of which was related to the local environment ( 32%). We found that putative “core” microbial taxa (i.e., present on all Phyllospora individuals sampled) exhibited slightly higher associations with host traits when compared to “variable” taxa (not present on all individuals). We identified several key genetic loci and phenotypic traits in Phyllospora that were strongly related to multiple microbial amplicon sequence variants, including taxa with known associations to seaweed defence, disease and tissue degradation. This information on how host-associated microbial communities vary with host traits and the environment enhances our current understanding of how “holobionts” (hosts plus their microbiota) are structured. Such understanding can be used to inform management strategies of these important and vulnerable habitats.

AB  - The supply of healthy sporelings plays a crucial role in the successful aquaculture of commercially cultivated brown kelp Saccharina japonica. Epibacteria are of critical importance for maintaining seaweed health and development. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the epibacterial community associated with mature sporophytes and 1.5- and 2.0-month-old sporelings, as well as juvenile sporophytes of S. japonica by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and predicted the bacterial functional profiles. We found that Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were the main phyla, while Loktanella and Rubritalea and Persicirhabdus were the dominant genera for all four developmental stages. Highly abundant core microbiota included Persicirhabdus, Loktanella, Litorimonas, and Rubritalea. Further analysis of the predicted functions showed that different metabolic functions were involved at different developmental stages. More metabolic functions were found in 2-month-old sporelings and mature sporophytes. Both the diversity, composition of the epiphytic bacterial communities, and metabolic functions changed according to different developmental stages at least in 1.5- and 2-month-old sporelings. Our results not only provide fundamental knowledge for the epibacteria associated with S. japonica but will also help nursery farms in preventing and mitigating the disease outbreaks by monitoring the variations of the epibacterial communities at the nursery stage.

AB  - Kelp are important primary producers that are colonized by diverse microbes that can have both positive and negative effects on their hosts. The kelp microbiome could support the burgeoning kelp cultivation sector by improving host growth, stress tolerance, and resistance to disease. Fundamental questions about the cultivated kelp microbiome still need to be addressed before microbiome-based approaches can be developed. A critical knowledge gap is how cultivated kelp microbiomes change as hosts grow, particularly following outplanting to sites that vary in abiotic conditions and microbial source pools. In this study we assessed if microbes that colonize kelp in the nursery stage persist after outplanting. We characterized microbiome succession over time on two species of kelp, Alaria marginata and Saccharina latissima, outplanted to open ocean cultivation sites in multiple geographic locations. We tested for host-species specificity of the microbiome and the effect of different abiotic conditions and microbial source pools on kelp microbiome stability during the cultivation process. We found the microbiome of kelp in the nursery is distinct from that of outplanted kelp. Few bacteria persisted on kelp following outplanting. Instead, we identified significant microbiome differences correlated with host species and microbial source pools at each cultivation site. Microbiome variation related to sampling month also indicates that seasonality in host and/or abiotic factors may influence temporal succession and microbiome turnover in cultivated kelps. This study provides a baseline understanding of microbiome dynamics during kelp cultivation and highlights research needs for applying microbiome manipulation to kelp cultivation.

AB  - The microbiome of macroalgae facilitates their adaptation to environmental stress. As bacteria release algal growth and morphogenesis promoting factors (AGMPFs), which are necessary for the healthy development of macroalgae, bacteria play a crucial role in stress adaptation of bacterial-algal interactions. To better understand the level of macroalgal dependence on the microbiome under various stress factors such as light, temperature, salt, or micropollutants, we propose a reductionist analysis of a tripartite model system consisting of the axenic green alga Ulva (Chlorophyta) re-infected with two essential bacteria. This analysis will allow us to decipher the stress response of each symbiont within this cross-kingdom interaction. The paper highlights studies on possible survival strategies embedded in cross-kingdom interactions that govern the stress adaptation, including general features of metabolic pathways in the macroalgal host or more specific features such as alterations in the composition and/or diversity of bacterial assemblages within the microbiome community. Additionally, we present some preliminary results regarding the effect of recently isolated bacteria from the Potter Cove, King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo) in Antarctica, on the model system Ulva mutabilis Føyn purified gametes. The results indicate that cold-adapted bacteria release AGMPFs, inducing cell differentiation, and cell division in purified cultures. We propose that microbiome engineering can be used to increase the adaptability of macroalgae to stressful situations with implications for, e.g., the sustainable management of (land-based) aquaculture systems.

AB  - Like most eukaryotes, brown algae live in association with bacterial communities that frequently have beneficial effects on their development. Ectocarpus is a genus of small filamentous brown algae, which comprises a strain that has recently colonized freshwater, a rare transition in this lineage. We generated an inventory of bacteria in Ectocarpus cultures and examined the effect they have on acclimation to an environmental change, that is, the transition from seawater to freshwater medium. Our results demonstrate that Ectocarpus depends on bacteria for this transition: cultures that have been deprived of their associated microbiome do not survive a transfer to freshwater, but restoring their microflora also restores the capacity to acclimate to this change. Furthermore, the transition between the two culture media strongly affects the bacterial community composition. Examining a range of other closely related algal strains, we observed that the presence of two bacterial operational taxonomic units correlated significantly with an increase in low salinity tolerance of the algal culture. Despite differences in the community composition, no indications were found for functional differences in the bacterial metagenomes predicted to be associated with algae in the salinities tested, suggesting functional redundancy in the associated bacterial community. Our study provides an example of how microbial communities may impact the acclimation and physiological response of algae to different environments, and thus possibly act as facilitators of speciation. It paves the way for functional examinations of the underlying host–microbe interactions, both in controlled laboratory and natural conditions.

AB  - It is unclear how host-associated microbial communities will be affected by future environmental change. Characterizing how microbiota differ across sites with varying environmental conditions and assessing the stability of the microbiota in response to abiotic variation are critical steps towards predicting outcomes of environmental change. Intertidal organisms are valuable study systems because they experience extreme variation in environmental conditions on tractable timescales such as tide cycles and across small spatial gradients in the intertidal zone. Here we show a widespread intertidal macroalgae, Fucus distichus, hosts site-specific microbiota over small (meters to kilometres) spatial scales. We demonstrate stability of site-specific microbial associations by manipulating the host environment and microbial species pool with common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. We hypothesized that F. distichus microbiota would readily shift to reflect the contemporary environment due to selective filtering by abiotic conditions and/or colonization by microbes from the new environment or nearby hosts. Instead, F. distichus microbiota was stable for days after transplantation in both the laboratory and field. Our findings expand the current understanding of microbiota dynamics on an intertidal foundation species. These results may also point to adaptations for withstanding short-term environmental variation, in hosts and/or microbes, facilitating stable host–microbial associations.

AB  - Marine macroalgae are constantly exposed to epibacterial colonizers. The epiphytic bacterial patterns and their temporal and spatial variability on host algae are poorly understood. To investigate the interaction between marine macroalgae and epiphytic bacteria, this study tested if the composition of epibacterial communities on different macroalgae was specific and persisted under varying biotic and abiotic environmental conditions over a 2-year observation time frame. Epibacterial communities on the co-occurring macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Ulva intestinalis were repeatedly sampled in summer and winter of 2007 and 2008. The epibacterial community composition was analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene libraries. Epibacterial community profiles did not only differ significantly at each sampling interval among algal species, but also showed consistent seasonal differences on each algal species at a bacterial phylum level. These compositional patterns re-occurred at the same season of two consecutive years. Within replicates of the same algal species, the composition of bacterial phyla was subject to shifts at the bacterial species level, both within the same season but at different years and between different seasons. However, 7–16% of sequences were identified as species specific to the host alga. These findings demonstrate that marine macroalgae harbour species-specific and temporally adapted epiphytic bacterial biofilms on their surfaces. Since several algal host-specific bacteria were highly similar to other bacteria known to either avoid subsequent colonization by eukaryotic larvae or to exhibit potent antibacterial activities, algal host-specific bacterial associations are expected to play an important role for marine macroalgae.

TI  - Incubation with macroalgae induces large shifts in water column microbiota, but minor changes to the epibiota of co-occurring macroalgae
AU  - Chen, Melissa Y.

T2  - Molecular Ecology
AB  - Macroalgae variably promote and deter microbial growth through release of organic carbon and antimicrobial compounds into the water column. Consequently, macroalgae influence the microbial composition of the surrounding water column and biofilms on nearby surfaces. Here, we use manipulative experiments to test the hypotheses that (i) Nereocystis luetkeana and Mastocarpus sp. macroalgae alter the water column microbiota in species-specific manner, that (ii) neighbouring macroalgae alter the bacterial communities on the surface (epibiota) of actively growing Nereocystis luetkeana meristem fragments (NMFs), and that (iii) neighbours alter NMF growth rate. We also assess the impact of laboratory incubation on macroalgal epibiota by comparing each species to wild counterparts. We find strong differences between the Nereocystis and Mastocarpus epibiota that are maintained in the laboratory. Nereocystis and Mastocarpus alter water column bacterial community composition and richness in a species specific manner, but cause only small compositional shifts on NMF surfaces that do not differ by species, and do not change richness. Co-incubation with macroalgae results in significant change in abundance of fivefold more genera in the water column compared to NMF surfaces, although the direction (i.e., enrichment or reduction) of shift is generally consistent between the water and NMF surfaces. Finally, NMFs grew during the experiment, but growth did not depend on the presence or identity of neighbouring macroalgae. Thus, macroalgae exhibit a strong and species-specific influence on the water column microbiota, but a much weaker influence on the epibiota of neighbouring macroalgae. Overall, these results support the idea that macroalgae surfaces are highly selective and demonstrate that modulations of macroalgal microbiota operate within an overarching paradigm of host species specificity.

AB  - Macroalgal surfaces support abundant and diverse microorganisms within biofilms, which are often involved in fundamental functions relating to the health and defense of their seaweed hosts, including algal development, facilitation of spore release, and chemical antifouling. Given these intimate and important interactions, environmental changes have the potential to negatively impact macroalgae by disrupting seaweed–microbe interactions. We used the disappearance of the dominant canopy-forming fucoid Phyllospora comosa from the metropolitan coast of Sydney, NSW, Australia as a model system to study these interactions. We transplanted Phyllospora individuals from nearby, extant populations back onto reefs in Sydney to test whether bacterial assemblages associated with seaweed surfaces would be influenced by (i) the host itself, independently of where it occurs, (ii) the type of habitat where the host occurs, or (iii) site-specific differences. Analyses of bacterial DNA fingerprints (terminal fragment length polymorphisms) indicated that assemblages of bacteria on Phyllospora were not habitat-specific. Rather, they were primarily influenced by local, site-specific conditions with some evidence for host-specificity in some cases. This could suggest a lottery model of host-surface colonization, by which hosts are colonized by ‘suitable’ bacteria available in the local species pool, resulting in high variability in assemblage structure across sites, but where some species in the community are specific to the host and possibly influenced by differences in host traits.

AB  - Ulva is a ubiquitous macroalgal genus of commercial interest. Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems promise large-scale production of macroalgae due to their high productivity and environmental sustainability. Complex host–microbiome interactions play a decisive role in macroalgal development, especially in Ulva spp. due to algal growth- and morphogenesis-promoting factors released by associated bacteria. However, our current understanding of the microbial community assembly and structure in cultivated macroalgae is scant. We aimed to determine (i) to what extent IMTA settings influence the microbiome associated with U. rigida and its rearing water, (ii) to explore the dynamics of beneficial microbes to algal growth and development under IMTA settings, and (iii) to improve current knowledge of host–microbiome interactions. We examined the diversity and taxonomic composition of the prokaryotic communities associated with wild versus IMTA-grown Ulva rigida and surrounding seawater by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. With 3141 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), the prokaryotic richness was, overall, higher in water than in association with U. rigida. Bacterial ASVs were more abundant in aquaculture water samples than water collected from the lagoon. The beta diversity analysis revealed distinct prokaryotic communities associated with Ulva collected in both aquacultures and coastal waters. Aquaculture samples (water and algae) shared 22% of ASVs, whereas natural, coastal lagoon samples only 9%. While cultivated Ulva selected 239 (8%) host-specific ASVs, wild specimens possessed more than twice host-specific ASVs (17%). Cultivated U. rigida specimens enriched the phyla Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria. Within the Gammaproteobacteria, while Glaciecola mostly dominated the microbiome in cultivated algae, the genus Granulosicoccus characterized both Ulva microbiomes. In both wild and IMTA settings, the phylum Bacteroidetes was more abundant in the bacterioplankton than in direct association with U. rigida. However, we observed that the Saprospiraceae family within this phylum was barely present in lagoon water but very abundant in aquaculture water. Aquaculture promoted the presence of known morphogenesis-inducing bacteria in water samples. Our study suggests that IMTA significantly shaped the structure and composition of the microbial community of the rearing water and cultivated U. rigida. Detailed analysis revealed the presence of previously undetected taxa associated with Ulva, possessing potentially unknown functional traits.

AB  - Marine microbes mediate key ecological processes in kelp forest ecosystems and interact with macroalgae. Pelagic and biofilm-associated microbes interact with macroalgal propagules at multiple stages of recruitment, yet these interactions have not been described for Macrocystis pyrifera. Here we investigate the influence of microbes from coastal environments on recruitment of giant kelp, M. pyrifera. Through repeated laboratory experiments, we tested the effects of altered pelagic microbial abundance on the settlement and development of the microscopic propagules of M. pyrifera during recruitment. M. pyrifera zoospores were reared in laboratory microcosms exposed to environmental microbial communities from seawater during the complete haploid stages of the kelp recruitment cycle, including zoospore release, followed by zoospore settlement, to gametophyte germination and development. We altered the microbial abundance states differentially in three independent experiments with repeated trials, where microbes were (a) present or absent in seawater, (b) altered in community composition, and (c) altered in abundance. Within the third experiment, we also tested the effect of nearshore versus offshore microbial communities on the macroalgal propagules. Distinct pelagic microbial communities were collected from two southern California temperate environments reflecting contrasting intensity of human influence, the nearshore Point Loma kelp forest and the offshore Santa Catalina Island kelp forest. The Point Loma kelp forest is a high impacted coastal region adjacent to the populous San Diego Bay; whereas the kelp forest at Catalina Island is a low impacted region of the Channel Islands, 40 km offshore the southern California coast, and is adjacent to a marine protected area. Kelp gametophytes reared with nearshore Point Loma microbes showed lower survival, growth, and deteriorated morphology compared to gametophytes with the offshore Catalina Island microbial community, and these effects were magnified under high microbial abundances. Reducing abundance of Point Loma microbes restored M. pyrifera propagule success. Yet an intermediate microbial abundance was optimal for kelp propagules reared with Catalina Island microbes, suggesting that microbes also have a beneficial influence on kelp. Our study shows that pelagic microbes from nearshore and offshore environments are differentially influencing kelp propagule success, which has significant implications for kelp recruitment and kelp forest ecosystem health.

AB  - Climate change is driving global declines of marine habitat-forming species through physiological effects and through changes to ecological interactions, with projected trajectories for ocean warming and acidification likely to exacerbate such impacts in coming decades. Interactions between habitat-formers and their microbiomes are fundamental for host functioning and resilience, but how such relationships will change in future conditions is largely unknown. We investigated independent and interactive effects of warming and acidification on a large brown seaweed, the kelp Ecklonia radiata, and its associated microbiome in experimental mesocosms. Microbial communities were affected by warming and, during the first week, by acidification. During the second week, kelp developed disease-like symptoms previously observed in the field. The tissue of some kelp blistered, bleached and eventually degraded, particularly under the acidification treatments, affecting photosynthetic efficiency. Microbial communities differed between blistered and healthy kelp for all treatments, except for those under future conditions of warming and acidification, which after two weeks resembled assemblages associated with healthy hosts. This indicates that changes in the microbiome were not easily predictable as the severity of future climate scenarios increased. Future ocean conditions can change kelp microbiomes and may lead to host disease, with potentially cascading impacts on associated ecosystems.

AB  - Microfouling in temperate seas underlies seasonal variations. Thus, perennial macroalgae are exposed to fluctuating levels of fouling pressure. Only few studies have examined the link between fouling pressure and algal fouling control. We assessed whether microfouling control of F. vesiculosus and F. serratus against prokaryotes and pennate diatoms fluctuates with season and correlates with microfouling pressure in a 1-year field survey. Microfouler recruitment on glass (reference surface) and on Fucus, microfouling control strength of Fucus surface metabolites (tested by an in situ bioassay approach) and Fucus tissue mannitol content (used as proxy for energy availability) were determined monthly. Microfouling pressure (settled cells per unit time and area) and microfouling control of Fucus varied seasonally. Both Fucus species exhibited cuticula shedding in all seasons. We conclude that microfouling control in both Fucus species showed a lagged or synchronized relationship with mannitol or microfouling pressure.

AB  - Seaweed-associated microbiota experience spatial and temporal shifts in response to changing environmental conditions and seaweed physiology. These shifts may result in structural, functional and behavioral changes in the host with potential consequences for its fitness. They, thus, may help the host to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The current knowledge of seasonal variation of seaweed-associated microbiota is however still limited. In this study, we explored temporal and spatial variation of microbial communities associated with the invasive brown seaweed S. muticum. We sampled in northern and southern Portugal, in September, March and July-August (summer). In addition, as (pseudo-)perennial seaweeds display seasonal reproductive phenology, we sampled various parts of the individuals to disentangle the effect of temporal changes from those due to structural development variations. The diversity and structure of associated microbial communities were determined using next generation sequencing of the variable regions V5-7 of the 16S rDNA. We expected to find differentiation in associated microbial communities between regions and sampling months, but with differences depending on the seaweed structure examined. As expected, the study revealed substantial temporal shifts in S. muticum microbiome, for instance with large abundance of Rhodobacteraceae and Loktanella in September-March but prevalence of Pirellulales during the summer months. Variations between regions and tissues were also observed: in northern Portugal and on basal structures, bacterial diversity was higher as compared to the South and apical parts. All examined seaweed structures showed temporal differences in associated microbial community structure over time, except for holdfasts between September and March. Bacteria contributing to these changes varied spatially. Conversely to all other structures, the holdfast also did not show differences in associated community structure between southern and northern regions. Our study highlights the importance of structural microscale differentiations within seaweeds hosts with regard to their associated microbial communities and their importance across temporal and spatial dimensions.

T2  - Frontiers in Microbiology
AB  - Canopy-forming kelps create underwater forests that are among the most productive marine ecosystems. On the Pacific coast of North America, two canopy-forming kelps with contrasting life histories co-occur; Macrocystis pyrifera, a perennial species, and Nereocystis luetkeana, an annual species. Kelp blade-associated microbes were sampled from 12 locations across a spatial gradient in Washington, United States, from the outer Pacific Coast to Puget Sound. Microbial communities were characterized using next-generation Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. At higher taxonomic levels (bacterial phylum and class), canopy-forming kelps hosted remarkably similar microbial communities, but at the amplicon sequence variant level, microbial communities on M. pyrifera and N. luetkeana were host-specific and distinct from free-living bacteria in the surrounding seawater. Microbial communities associated with blades of each kelp species displayed significant geographic variation. The microbiome of N. luetkeana changed along the spatial gradient and was significantly correlated to salinity, with outer Pacific coast sites enriched in Bacteroidetes (family Saprospiraceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Granulosicoccus sp.), and southern Puget Sound sites enriched in Alphaproteobacteria (family Hyphomonadaceae). We also examined microbial community development and succession on meristematic and apical N. luetkeana blade tissues throughout the summer growing season on Tatoosh Island, WA. Across all dates, microbial communities were less diverse on younger, meristematic blade tissue compared to the older, apical tissues. In addition, phylogenetic relatedness among microbial taxa increased from meristematic to apical blade tissues, suggesting that the addition of microbial taxa to the community was a non-random process that selected for certain phylogenetic groups of microbes. Microbial communities on older, apical tissues displayed significant temporal variation throughout the summer and microbial taxa that were differentially abundant over time displayed clear patterns of community succession. Overall, we report that host species identity, geographic location, and blade tissue age shape the microbial communities on canopy-forming kelps.

AB  - Disease outbreaks cause severe economic losses in commercially cultivated Saccharina japonica. Epiphytic bacteria are increasingly recognized to play an important role in S. japonica health and may also become opportunistic pathogens when the environment deteriorates. However, there is little knowledge about the epiphytic bacterial communities associated with commercially cultivated S. japonica and how these communities change over the harvest season. We analyzed the diversity, composition, and temporal dynamics of epiphytic bacterial communities associated with both healthy and diseased tissue of S. japonica over a harvest season (from April to June, 2015) at Ailian Bay, Rongcheng, China. Our results showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the main phyla and Halomonas spp. were the most dominant bacterial species. Halomonadaceae, Hyphomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Phyllobacteriaceae families were abundant in both healthy and diseased S. japonica, but the relative abundance of these bacteria differed between healthy and diseased groups. Spatial (site 1, site 2, and site 3 in April) and temporal comparisons (site 3 from April to June) revealed that the bacterial community associated with cultivated S. japonica was influenced by sampling time and sampling site independent of the health status. Several OTUs from the Roseobacter group, including members of the genera Sulfitobacter and Loktanella, were enriched in diseased tissues suggesting these taxa could be candidate opportunistic pathogens. In contrast, OTUs belonging to the genera Halomonas were enriched in healthy tissues, indicating a potential beneficial role for group during the cultivation of S. japonica. Our results provide important baseline knowledge of the epiphytic bacterial communities and possibly pathogenic bacteria associated with commercially cultivated S. japonica.

AB  - The macroalga Fucus vesiculosus carries a specific community of surface bacteria. To identify chemical compounds that possibly mediate abundance and community composition of algae-associated bacteria, we tested the effect of surface-available algal compounds on bacterial settlement and community composition under field conditions. Compounds on algal thalli were separated from the surface by extraction with organic solvents and investigated on growth inhibition and settlement of bacterial isolates. Based on in vitro data, partially purified extract fractions were then exposed to bacterial colonizers in vivo followed by bacterial enumeration and community analysis. The polar fraction of the algal surface extract revealed a significant profouling effect for Vibrionales, whereas the nonpolar fraction – containing the xanthophyll pigment fucoxanthin and other unidentified nonpolar surface compounds – revealed a significant 80% reduction of surface colonizing bacteria. The analysis of bacterial surface communities by 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated that the antifouling activity of nonpolar algal surface compounds was targeting the abundance of natural bacterial colonizers rather than the relative composition of bacterial members within the community. Moreover, the bacterial community composition on F. vesiculosus was markedly different from artificial control substrates and chemically manipulated experimental treatments, suggesting that other, nonextractable surface features and/or physical properties render algal-specific epiphytic bacterial communities.

AB  - The thallus surface of the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus is covered by a specific biofilm community. This biofilm supposedly plays an important role in the interaction between host and environment. So far, we know little about compositional or functional shifts of this epibiotic bacterial community under changing environmental conditions. In this study, the response of the microbiota to different temperatures with respect to cell density and community composition was analyzed by nonculture-based methods (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene). Redundancy analysis showed that despite high variability among host individuals temperature accounted for 20% of the variation in the bacterial community composition, whereas cell density did not differ between groups. Across all samples, 4341 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level were identified. Eight percent of OTUs were significantly correlated with low, medium, and high temperatures. Notably, the family Rhodobacteraceae increased in relative abundance from 20% to 50% with increasing temperature. OTU diversity (evenness and richness) was higher at 15°C than at the lower and higher temperatures. Considering their known and presumed ecological functions for the host, change in the epibacterial community may entail shifts in the performance of the host alga.

AB  - Epibiotic biofilms have the potential to control major aspects of the biology and ecology of their hosts. Their composition and function may thus be essential for the health of the host. We tested the influence of salinity on the composition of epibacterial communities associated with the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus. Algal individuals were incubated at three salinities (5, 19, and 25) for 14 days and nonliving reference substrata (stones) were included in the experiment. Subsequently, the composition of their surface-associated bacterial communities was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Redundancy analysis revealed that the composition of epiphytic and epilithic communities significantly differed and were both affected by salinity. We found that 5% of 2494 epiphytic operational taxonomic units at 97% sequence similarity were responsible for the observed shifts. Epibacterial α-diversity was significantly lower at salinity 5 but did not differ between substrata. Our results indicate that salinity is an important factor in structuring alga-associated epibacterial communities with respect to composition and/or diversity. Whether direct or indirect mechanisms (via altered biotic interactions) may have been responsible for the observed shifts is discussed.

AB  - Brown algae are key components of marine ecosystems and live in association with bacteria that are essential for their growth and development. Ectocarpus siliculosus is a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. Here we use this model to start disentangling the complex interactions that may occur between the algal host and its associated bacteria. We report the genome-sequencing of 10 alga-associated bacteria and the genome-based reconstruction of their metabolic networks. The predicted metabolic capacities were then used to identify metabolic complementarities between the algal host and the bacteria, highlighting a range of potentially beneficial metabolite exchanges between them. These putative exchanges allowed us to predict consortia consisting of a subset of these ten bacteria that would best complement the algal metabolism. Finally, co-culture experiments were set up with a subset of these consortia to monitor algal growth as well as the presence of key algal metabolites. Although we did not fully control but only modified bacterial communities in our experiments, our data demonstrated a significant increase in algal growth in cultures inoculated with the selected consortia. In several cases, we also detected, in algal extracts, the presence of key metabolites predicted to become producible via an exchange of metabolites between the alga and the microbiome. Thus, although further methodological developments will be necessary to better control and understand microbial interactions in Ectocarpus, our data suggest that metabolic complementarity is a good indicator of beneficial metabolite exchanges in the holobiont.

T2  - Frontiers in Marine Science
AB  - Climate change is characterized not only by an increase in mean temperature, but also an increase in the variability around the means causing extreme events like marine heatwaves. These events are expected to have strong influence on the ecology of marine foundation species such as the eelgrass Zostera marina. Bacterial and macroscopic foulers are ubiquitous in the marine environment; they can have detrimental impacts on macrophytes and warming is known to enhance bacterial fouling. Thus, to investigate the consequence of heatwaves on the chemical defense of eelgrass against microbial colonizers, we incubated Z. marina plants in the Kiel Outdoor Benthocosm system under ambient control conditions and two different heatwave treatments: a treatment experiencing two spring heatwaves followed by a summer heatwave, and a treatment only experiencing just the summer heatwave. The capacity to deter microbial colonizers was found to be significantly up-regulated in Z. marina from both heatwave treatments in comparison to Z. marina under control conditions, suggesting defense regulation of Z. marina in response to marine heatwaves. We conclude climate extremes such as heatwaves can trigger a regulation in the defense capacity, which could be necessary for resilience against climate change scenarios. Such dynamics in rapid regulation of defense capacity as found in this study could also apply to other host plant – microbe interactions under scenarios of ongoing climate change or extreme climate events like heatwaves.

AB  - Macroalgae constitute one of the preferred substrates of the benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata. Across the Mediterranean Sea, this toxic microalga has been shown to thrive on the surface of various species of macroalgae, including Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyceae. Interestingly, some Dictyotaceae are characterized by a low abundance of cells of O. cf. ovata on their surface. Based on the antifouling properties of some specialized metabolites produced by seaweeds, macroalgal metabolites have been proposed to contribute to the settlement and development of O. cf. ovata. To address this question, the composition of the surface of four Dictyotaceae, Dictyota dichotoma, Dictyota spiralis, Taonia atomaria, and Padina pavonica was investigated through an integrative approach combining the analysis of their eukaryotic diversity (18S rRNA gene metabarcoding), their surface metabolome (untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics) as well as the bioactivity of their surface extracts on O. cf. ovata. Altogether, the data suggest an influence of the macroalgal surface chemistry on the growth of the dinoflagellate, with D. dichotoma being the most bioactive. Some metabolites are proposed to be involved in the observed bioactivity. Other biotic factors are also likely to be entailed in the control of the O. cf. ovata population and they may even prevail on the influence of the macroalgal surface chemistry.

AB  - Characterizing patterns in the microbial communities associated with canopy-forming kelps is critical to understanding the mechanisms shaping macroalgal microbiomes. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized bacterial and archaeal communities associated with giant kelp in the Santa Barbara Channel. Our results indicate that kelp-associated microbial communities are altered in the presence of epiphytic bryozoans and reflect changes previously observed in other studies of stressed macroalgae. This observation is indicative of patterns of microbiome disruption (dysbiosis) and opportunistic pathogenesis that may have implications for the health and productivity of foundational species of macroalgae. Our study highlights new patterns in host–microbiome associations and reveals the importance of considering host source and condition when investigating the dynamics of macroalgal microbiomes.

AB  - Seaweed-associated microbiota are essential for the health and resilience of nearshore ecosystems, marine biogeochemical cycling, and host health. Yet much remains unknown about the ecology of seaweed–microbe symbioses. In this study, we quantified fine-scale patterns of microbial community structure across distinct anatomical regions of the kelp Laminaria setchellii. These anatomical regions represent a gradient of tissue ages: perennial holdfasts can be several years old, whereas stipe epicortex and blades are younger annual structures. Within blades, new growth occurs at the base, while the blade tips may be several months old and undergoing senescence. We hypothesized that microbial communities will differ across anatomical regions (holdfast, stipe, blade base, and blade tip), such that younger tissues will harbor fewer microbes that are more consistent across replicate individuals. Our data support this hypothesis, with the composition of bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and microeukaryote (18S rRNA gene) communities showing significant differences across the four anatomical regions, with the surfaces of older tissues (holdfast and blade tips) harboring significantly greater microbial richness compared to the younger tissues of the meristematic region. Additional samples collected from the surfaces of new L. setchellii recruits (<1y old) also showed differences in microbial community structure across anatomical regions, which demonstrates that these microbial differences are established early. We also observed this pattern in two additional algal species, suggesting that microbial community structure across host anatomy may be a common feature of the seaweed microbiome.

AB  - Macroalgal life histories are complex, often involving the alternation of distinct free-living life history phases that differ in morphology, longevity and ploidy. The surfaces of marine macroalgae support diverse microbial biofilms, yet the degree of microbial variation between alternate phases is unknown. We quantified bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and microeukaryote (18S rRNA gene) communities on the surface of the common intertidal seaweed, Mastocarpus spp., which alternates between gametophyte (foliose, haploid) and sporophyte (encrusting, diploid) life history phases. A large portion (97%) of bacterial taxa on the surface Mastocarpus was also present in samples from the environment, indicating that macroalgal surface communities are largely assembled from the surrounding seawater. Still, changes in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa result in significantly different communities on alternate Mastocarpus life history phases, rocky substrate and seawater at all intertidal elevations. For microeukaryote assemblages, only high intertidal samples had significant differences between life history phases although sporophytes were not different from the rocky substrate at this elevation; gametophytes and sporophytes did not differ in microeukaryote communities in the mid and low zones. By sequencing three host genes, we identified three cryptic species of Mastocarpus in our data set, which co-occur in the mid-to-low intertidal zone. In these samples, M. alaskensis sporophytes harboured distinct bacterial communities compared to M. agardhii and M. intermedius sporophytes, which were not distinguishable. Conversely, microeukaryote communities did not differ among species.

AB  - Host-associated microbial communities play a fundamental role in the life of eukaryotic hosts. It is increasingly argued that hosts and their microbiota must be studied together as 'holobionts' to better understand the effects of environmental stressors on host functioning. Disruptions of host–microbiota interactions by environmental stressors can negatively affect host performance and survival. Substantial ecological impacts are likely when the affected hosts are habitat-forming species (e.g., trees, kelps) that underpin local biodiversity. In marine systems, coastal urbanisation via the addition of artificial structures is a major source of stress to habitat formers, but its effect on their associated microbial communities is unknown. We characterised kelp-associated microbial communities in two of the most common and abundant artificial structures in Sydney Harbour—pier-pilings and seawalls—and in neighbouring natural rocky reefs. The kelp Ecklonia radiata is the dominant habitat-forming species along 8000 km of the temperate Australian coast. Kelp-associated microbial communities on pilings differed significantly from those on seawalls and natural rocky reefs, possibly due to differences in abiotic (e.g., shade) and biotic (e.g., grazing) factors between habitats. Many bacteria that were more abundant on kelp on pilings belonged to taxa often associated with macroalgal diseases, including tissue bleaching in Ecklonia. There were, however, no differences in kelp photosynthetic capacity between habitats. The observed differences in microbial communities may have negative effects on the host by promoting fouling by macroorganisms or by causing and spreading disease over time. This study demonstrates that urbanisation can alter the microbiota of key habitat-forming species with potential ecological consequences.

AB  - Macroalgal holobiont studies involve understanding interactions between the host, its microbiota, and the environment. We analyzed the effect of bacteria–kelp interactions on phenotypic responses of two genetically distinct populations of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (north and south), exposed to different nitrogen (N) concentrations. In co-culture experiments with different N concentration treatments, we evaluated kelp growth responses and changes in three specific molecular markers associated with the N cycle, both in epiphytic bacteria (relative abundance of nrfA-gene: cytochrome c nitrite reductase) and macroalgae (expression of NR-gene: nitrate reductase; GluSyn-gene: glutamate synthase). Both kelp populations responded differently to N limitation, with M. pyrifera-south sporophytes having a lower specific growth rate (SGR) under N-limiting conditions than the northern population; M. pyrifera-north sporophytes showed no significant differences in SGR when exposed to low-N and high-N concentrations. This corresponded to a higher GluSyn-gene expression in the M. pyrifera-north sporophytes and the co-occurrence of specific nrfA bacterial taxa. These bacteria may increase ammonium availability under low-N concentrations, allowing M. pyrifera-north to optimize nutrient assimilation by increasing the expression of GluSyn. We conclude that bacteria–kelp interactions are important in enhancing kelp growth rates under low N availability, although this effect may be regulated by the genetic background of kelp populations.

AB  - Most current approaches to analyse metagenomic data rely on reference genomes. Novel microbial communities extend far beyond the coverage of reference databases and de novo metagenome assembly from complex microbial communities remains a great challenge. Here we present a novel experimental and bioinformatic framework, metaSort, for effective construction of bacterial genomes from metagenomic samples. MetaSort provides a sorted mini-metagenome approach based on flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing methodologies, and employs new computational algorithms to efficiently recover high-quality genomes from the sorted mini-metagenome by the complementary of the original metagenome. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrated that metaSort has an excellent and unbiased performance on genome recovery and assembly. Furthermore, we applied metaSort to an unexplored microflora colonized on the surface of marine kelp and successfully recovered 75 high-quality genomes at one time. This approach will greatly improve access to microbial genomes from complex or novel communities.

AB  - Microalgae have major functions in global biogeochemical cycles and are promising sources of renewable energy, yet the relationships between algal hosts and their associated microbiomes remain relatively underexplored. Understanding community organization of microalgal microbiomes, such as how algal species identity influences bacterial community structure, will aid in efforts to engineer more efficient phototrophic ecosystems. Here, we examined the community assembly of phycosphere-associated (attached) and free-living bacterial taxa associated with two marine microalgae: the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and eustigmatophyte Microchloropsis salina. Samples were collected from outdoor mesocosms, raceway ponds, and laboratory enrichments, and bacterial taxa identified by 16S rRNA gene sequences. In outdoor mesocosms, we found distinct bacterial taxa associated with each algal species, including the Cytophagaceae and Rhodobacteraceae families with P. tricornutum, and Rhodobacteraceae, Hyphomonadaceae, and Saprospiraceae with M. salina. Additionally, there were host-specific differences in the bacterial genera associated with the phycosphere, including Novosphingobium and Rhodopirellula with P. tricornutum, and Methylophaga and Dyadobacter with M. salina. Bacterial communities from outdoor monoalgal P. tricornutum and polyalgal P. tricornutum/M. salina samples were used as inocula for laboratory enrichments with axenic P. tricornutum. Here, similar bacterial communities emerged, suggesting that the algal host exerts substantial influence over bacterial community assembly. Further enrichments for phycosphere-association revealed differing outcomes of community assembly processes contingent on the initial community composition. Phycosphere-associated communities from monoalgal P. tricornutum mesocosms were highly similar to one another, suggesting deterministic processes, whereas cultures from mixed M. salina/P. tricornutum raceways followed two apparent paths differentiated by the stochastic loss of specific community members and convergence towards or further deviation from the monoalgal samples. These results demonstrate that algal-associated bacterial communities are controlled by algal host, culture conditions, and the initial inoculum composition of the algal microbiome, and this knowledge can inform the engineering of more productive algal systems.

AB  - The mutualistic impacts of bacterial communities on algal growth and biomass accumulation are well documented, but it is unknown how temperature and light stress influence these mutualistic interactions. Here, we generated a bacteria-free (axenic) culture of the green alga Desmodesmus intermedius C046 and compared its growth and yield in the laboratory to its native xenic counterpart - featuring a microbiome that has been maintained with its algal host for at least 5 years – under unstressed and high light, high temperature stress conditions. We then added exogenous microbiomes from high light marine environments to the axenic culture to quantify the contribution of these newly generated microbial consortia in improving D. intermedius growth, yield, and resilience to high light and heat. The native microbiome increased growth and biomass accumulation, under both unstressed and stressed conditions. Three of the five newly derived microbiomes had increased growth compared to the axenic and negligible, decreased, or increased growth impacts compared to the xenic culture. Stress conditions led to decreased algal exudation, larger algal cells when grown alone, but smaller algal cells with an associated microbiome. Our results suggest that the algal microbiome plays a role in microalgal response to heat and light stress, and efforts for screening new algal strains for high biomass productivity under those stress conditions should include a strategy for microbiome optimization.

AB  - Macroalgal surface constitutes a peculiar ecological niche and an advantageous substratum for microorganisms able to degrade the wide diversity of algal glycans. The degrading enzymatic activities of macroalgal epiphytes are of paramount interest for the industrial by-product sector and biomass resource applications. We characterized the polysaccharide hydrolytic profile of bacterial isolates obtained from three macroalgal species: the red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis and Sphaerococcus coronopifolius (Rhodophyceae) and the brown Halopteris scoparia (Phaeophyceae), sampled in South Portugal. Bacterial enrichment cultures supplemented with chlorinated aliphatic compounds, typically released by marine algae, were established using as inoculum the decaying biomass of the three macroalgae, obtaining a collection of 634 bacterial strains. Although collected from the same site and exposed to the same seawater seeding microbiota, macroalgal cultivable bacterial communities in terms of functional and phylogenetic diversity showed host specificity. Isolates were tested for the hydrolysis of starch, pectin, alginate and agar, exhibiting a different hydrolytic potential according to their host: A. taxiformis showed the highest percentage of active isolates (91%), followed by S. coronopifolius (54%) and H. scoparia (46%). Only 30% of the isolates were able to degrade starch, while the other polymers were degraded by 55–58% of the isolates. Interestingly, several isolates showed promiscuous capacities to hydrolyze more than one polysaccharide. The isolate functional fingerprint was statistically correlated to bacterial phylogeny, host species and enrichment medium. In conclusion, this work depicts macroalgae as holobionts with an associated microbiota of interest for blue biotechnologies, suggesting isolation strategies and bacterial targets for polysaccharidases’ discovery.

AB  - The macroalgae surface allows specific bacterial communities to colonize, resulting in complex biological interactions. In recent years, several researchers have studied the diversity and function of the epiphytic bacteria associated with algal host, but largely these interactions remain underexplored. In the present study we analysed the cultivable diversity and polymer degradation potential of epiphytic bacteria associated with five different marine macroalgae (Sargassum, Ulva, Padina, Dictyota and Pterocladia sp.) sampled from the central west coast of India. Out of the total 360 strains isolated, purified and preserved, about 238 strains were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and processed for polymer (cellulose, pectin, xylan and starch) degrading activities. Phylogeny placed the strains within the classes Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Alpha-proteobacteria, and Gamma-proteobacteria and clustered them into 45 genera, wherein Vibrio, Bacillus, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, Staphylococcus and Kocuria spp. were the most abundant with 20 strains identified as potentially novel taxa within the genera Bacillus, Cellulosimicrobium, Gordonia, Marinomonas, Vibrio, Luteimonas and Pseudoalteromonas. In terms of polymer hydrolysis potential, 61.3% had xylanase activity, while 59.7%, 58.8%, and 52.2% had amylase, cellulase, and pectinase activity, respectively. Overall, 75.6% of the strains degraded more than one polysaccharide, 24% degraded all polymers, while nine strains (3.8%) degraded raw sugarcane bagasse. This study showed great potential for seaweed-associated bacteria in the bio-remediation of agro-waste based raw materials, which can be employed in the form of green technology.

AB  - The microbiota of eight species (Chondrus crispus, Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria ochroleuca, Palmaria palmata, Porphyra umbilicalis, Saccharina latissima, Ulva lactuca and Undaria pinnatifida) of edible seaweeds collected in North West Spain, marketed as dehydrated product, was quantitatively determined on nine solid media. Representative colonies were selected from solid culture media. The isolated microorganisms were identified by means of morphological characteristics, 16S rDNA sequencing and biochemical tests. U. pinnatifida was the seaweed species showing the most abundant microbial population, with counts on Marine agar up to 7.7 log cfu/g in individual samples and 5.0 log cfu/g as the mean value, and counts of coliforms up to 4.6 log cfu/g in individual samples and 2.4 log cfu/g as the mean value. The 225 identified bacterial isolates belonged to 11 families, 27 genera and 56 species. Bacillaceae was the family accounting for the highest number of isolates (111) followed by Enterobacteriaceae (60), Bacillales Family XII Incertae Sedis (20), Planococcaceae (11), Moraxellaceae (7), Paenibacillaceae (5) and Pseudomonadaceae (5). Bacterial species showing the highest occurrence in dehydrated seaweeds were Bacillus megaterium, B. licheniformis, Pantoea sp. and termoresistant Pantoea sp. Four of the Bacillus species isolated from dehydrated seaweeds (B. cereus, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus and B. subtilis) are among those containing strains considered to be foodborne pathogens and nine of the isolated non-Bacillales bacterial species have been reported to contain human opportunistic pathogenic strains.

AB  - The formation of epiphytic bacterial communities on macroalgae is closely related to host identity, but the effects of tissue location and sex of the host alga on this process, especially the relative contributions of these two factors, have not been studied. Here, the epiphytic bacterial community on three different tissues (tip, receptacle and holdfast) of male and female Sargassum thunbergii in the intertidal zone of Qingdao was investigated using high-throughput sequencing, and the results revealed obvious tissue and sex specificity of the epiphytic bacteria and significant differences from seawater bacterial samples. The biodiversity indexes, specific bacteria, biomarkers, indicator taxa and predicted function of epiphytic bacteria differed significantly among tissues of S. thunbergii and between sexes for the same tissue, confirming that both algal tissue location and sex impacted epiphytic bacterial community assembly on S. thunbergii. Additionally, β-diversity analysis showed that tissue location contributed more than host sex to epiphytic bacterial community structure, and the contributions of these two factors varied among tissues. Sex contributed less to epiphytic bacteria on the holdfast than on the tip and receptacle. Furthermore, the tissue and sex specificity of epiphytic bacteria on S. thunbergii were likely related mainly to host metabolism but also to the interaction between bacteria and algae and adaptability to the environment. This study shed light on the drivers of macroalga-associated bacterial community structure and broaden our understanding of the relationship between macroalgae and their epiphytic bacteria.

AB  - Profound growth differences such as seedling length and biomass are often observed during the cultivation of Sargassum fusiforme despite the absence of detectable variance in abiotic factors that could have affected this process. This highlights the importance of biotic factors such as epiphytic microbiota in controlling seedling growth. Yet, how, and to what extent microbial activities can affect host growth in the presence of seawater flow and continuous erosion remains debatable. Particularly, the contribution of microbial network interactions to the growth of macroalgae remains poorly understood. This study aimed to compare the physicochemical properties of S. fusiforme seedlings via 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing-based profiling of the epiphytic microbial communities of seedlings with different lengths. Significantly different epiphytic bacterial communities were observed among S. fusiforme seedlings of different lengths. The result showed that community from longer seedlings maintained higher bacterial diversity with the taxa Gammaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales, Alteromonadales, Vibrionaceae, Ralstonia, Colwelliaceae, and Thalassotalea being selectively enriched. More importantly, microbial interspecific interactions, which were predominantly positive, were enhanced consistently in communities of the longer seedlings, indicative of reinforced prevalent and mutually cooperative relationships among the microorganisms associated with S. fusiforme seedlings of greater length. Furthermore, longer seedlings also displayed up-regulation of microbial functional potentials involved in N fixation and mineralization, P mineralization and transportation, and ion transportation compared with shorter ones. Lastly, stochastic processes dominated the community assembly of the epiphytic microorganisms. These findings could provide new insights into the relationship between microbial communities and growth in S. fusiforme seedlings and enable us to predict the community diversity and assembly of macroalgae-associated microbial communities. This could have important implications for linking microbial community diversity and network interactions to their host productivity.

AB  - Stipitate kelp species such as Laminaria digitata dominate most cold-water subtidal rocky shores and form underwater forests which are among the most productive coastal systems worldwide. Laminaria also sustains rich bacterial communities which offer a variety of biotechnological applications. However, to date, in-depth studies on the diversity and uniqueness of bacterial communities associated with this macroalgal species, their ecological role and their interactions with the alga are under-represented. To address this, the epibacterial populations associated with different thallus regions (holdfast, stipe, meristem, blade) of this brown seaweed were investigated using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. The results show that epibacterial communities of the brown seaweed are significantly different and specific to the thallus region, with the shared bacterial population comprising of only 1.1% of the total amplicon sequence variants. The diverse holdfast and blade tissues formed distinct clusters while the meristem and stipe regions are more closely related. The data obtained further supports the hypothesis that macroalgal bacterial communities are shaped by morphological niches and display specificity.

AB  - Kelp species are distributed along ~ 25% of the world’s coastlines and the forests they form represent some of the world’s most productive and diverse ecosystems. Like other marine habitat–formers, the associated microbial community is fundamental for host and, in turn, wider ecosystem functioning. Given there are thousands of bacteria-host associations, determining which relationships are important remains a major challenge. We characterised the associated bacteria of two habitat-forming kelp species, Laminaria hyperborea and Saccharina latissima, from eight sites across a range of spatial scales (10 s of metres to 100 s of km) in the northeast Atlantic. We found no difference in diversity or community structure between the two kelps, but there was evidence of regional structuring (across 100 s km) and considerable variation between individuals (10 s of metres). Within sites, individuals shared few amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and supported a very small proportion of diversity found across the wider study area. However, consistent characteristics between individuals were observed with individual host communities containing a small conserved “core” (8–11 ASVs comprising 25 and 32% of sample abundances for L. hyperborea and S. latissima, respectively). At a coarser taxonomic resolution, communities were dominated by four classes (Planctomycetes, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia) that made up ~ 84% of sample abundances. Remaining taxa (47 classes) made up very little contribution to overall abundance but the majority of taxonomic diversity. Overall, our study demonstrates the consistent features of kelp bacterial communities across large spatial scales and environmental gradients and provides an ecologically meaningful baseline to track environmental change.

AB  - Epibacteria of seaweeds play an important role for the development of hosts and are influenced by the planktonic surrounding seawater bacteria. However, to date, the knowledges related to both epiphytic and surrounding seawater bacterial communities associated with northern farmed Saccharina japonica are very limited. In this study, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the shifts of epiphytic and surrounding seawater bacterial communities of the northern farmed S. japonica from mature sporophytes, sporelings (3 time points) to juvenile sporophytes (2 time points) were investigated. The dominant genera of epibacterial communities were Alcanivorax (mature sporophytes and 4-week-old sporelings), Bacillus (7-week-old sporelings and 9-week-old sporelings), Halomonas (4-week-old juvenile sporophytes) and Cobetia (9-week-old juvenile sporophytes). Meanwhile, the Chao1 indexes and beta diversity of epibacterial communities were significantly different with the development of S. japonica (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Alcanivorax, Bacillus and Halomonas were both dominant and core genera, indicating that these taxa may be beneficial to the development of S. japonica. The alpha diversity indexes of both epiphytic and surrounding seawater bacterial communities were significantly different for 9-week-old juvenile sporophytes. Therefore, the epibacterial communities were influenced by both development of S. japonica and the surrounding seawater bacterial communities. This study not only extends the understanding of the bacterial communities associated with the northern farmed S. japonica, but also help to make production management by monitoring the variations in both epiphytic and surrounding seawater bacterial communities.

AB  - Over 90% of introduced marine species are seaweeds. Seaweeds rely on their microbiome for host settlement, nutrition, development and health. As such, it is likely that microbiomes are involved in seaweed invasions. Sargassum muticum, indigenous to Southeast Asia, inhabits the North-east Atlantic from Norway to Morocco. This is the only known successful case of a non-clonal marine invader with almost no genetic variation over its large NE Atlantic introduced range. This makes it a very interesting model to study an invasive seaweeds microbiome, as it practically uncouples host genetic variation from microbiome variation. Associated bacteria potentially contribute to the plasticity and acclimation of S. muticum leading to its success over the last 50 years. Dispersing host organisms can either bring their acquired microbes along or obtain new ones locally, following the mutualist and generalist host hypothesis, respectively. We used partial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the total and core microbiome across S. muticum structures/tissues from five NE Atlantic regions, from Norway to Morocco, covering over 30° of latitude. In contrast to host genotypes, highly diverse, regional, total and core microbiomes, with differentiation levels depending on tissue, bacterial community structure were detected. Atlantic S. muticum follows the generalist host hypothesis, possibly recruiting a new microbiome in each new region. This host promiscuity may promote the invasiveness of S. muticum. Diversity was lower in the young/annual tissues compared with the older tissues for the total bacterial community, suggesting that these are mostly transitory bacteria accumulating over time in the older parts. The total core microbiome included 10 OTUs, representing dominant community members commonly found in other seaweeds’ cores. The core Granulosicoccus OTU followed a clear regional pattern where northern and southern regions clustered differentially, suggesting a regional signature even at an OTU level.

AB  - The community structures of epiphytic bacteria on the surface of macroalgae are closely related to their host algae, but there is a lack of research on the differences between the epiphytic bacterial communities of male and female algae and their reproductive tissues. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to compare epiphytic bacterial community structures on the intertidal macroalgae Sargassum thunbergii and their receptacles between male and female samples. The epiphytic bacteria on the male and female algal bodies and receptacles had similar community structures with a large number of shared bacteria, but the samples clearly clustered separately, and the abundances of dominant taxa, specific bacteria, and indicator species differed, indicating that epiphytic bacterial communities differed significantly between the male and female S. thunbergii and their receptacles. In addition, the abundance of many predicted functional genes was significantly different between epiphytic bacteria on male and female algal bodies and receptacles, especially metabolism-related genes, and the abundances of predicted functional genes of epiphytic bacteria were significantly higher on both types of male samples than on female samples. Our study confirmed that the sex of the host algae influenced the epiphytic bacterial community structures on algae and algal reproductive tissues, and this role was mainly related to the host metabolism. The results reveal the role of host plant sex in the formation of epiphytic bacterial communities. These findings are helpful for obtaining an in-depth understanding of the construction mechanism of algae-associated bacteria.

AB  - Macroalgae and their rocky substrates both support diverse and abundant microbiota, performing essential ecological functions in marine ecosystem. However, the differences in the epiphytic microbial communities on macroalgae and rocky substrate are still poorly understood. In this study, the epiphytic microbial communities on four macroalgae (Corallina officinalis, Rhodomela confervoides, Sargassum thunbergii, and Ulva linza) and their rocky substrates from Weihai coast zone were characterized using high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the alpha diversity indices were greater in rocky substrates than that in macroalgae. The microbial similarities among macroalgae and rocky substrate groups tended to decrease from the high taxonomic ranks to lower ranks, only 22.69% of the total amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were shared between them. The functional analysis revealed that the microbiotas were mainly involved in metabolic activities. This study would provide the theoretical foundation for macroalgal cultivation and algal reef applications.

AB  - Microbes are vitally important for seaweed growth, functioning and reproduction, and are likely to have a big impact on aquaculture. Algae-associated bacteria, however, remain mostly unmonitored in aquaculture. Here, we studied the microbiomes of Ulva australis and Ulva lacinulata, three natural populations and an aquaculture set-up, based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. The microbiome of cultivated Ulva was pronouncedly different from natural populations, and was specifically associated with higher relative abundances of known growth-promoting bacteria Sulfitobacter and Roseobacter. On a smaller scale, there were species-specific differences as well. In general, Ulva-associated communities were highly distinct from environmental seawater and sediment reference samples. We demonstrated a workflow generating full-length 16S rRNA sequences in real-time using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We compared 3 different reference databases to assign taxonomy with Kraken2 (SILVA, Greengenes and NCBI). In addition, we used Nanopore's cloud-based EPI2ME workflow for comparison. All four methods yielded comparable results in terms of relative abundances on phylum and order level, but differed widely in alpha diversity indices at genus level. Using the NCBI 16S database, especially in combination with the EPI2ME workflow, resulted in a high proportion of false identifications of cyanobacteria due to chloroplast contamination. Based on our results, we recommend assigning taxonomy of Nanopore-derived long-reads with Kraken2 and the SILVA database in seaweed-microbiome studies. The protocols used in this study provide results within 24 h and may be applicable for rapid microbial surveys in aquaculture.

AB  - Macroalgae surfaces are considered as potentially suitable substrata present underwater for the dynamic epibiotic microbiome. They secrete various organic substances as nutrients for the multiplication of bacteria and the formation of microbial biofilms. The microbial biofilm itself acts as a biological defence mechanism to prevent the establishment of pathogenic microbes as well as to protect the surface of the seaweed from the macrofoulers. In most cases, the presence and diversity of these organisms are host-specific. The macroalgal host and their associated microbiont are often referred to as a ‘Holobiont’. The surface-associated microbiome of macroalgae plays a crucial role in the growth, morphogenesis and defence in the normal favourable environmental conditions of the macroalgae (Symbiotism). Whereas, when there is a change i.e. reversed, unfavourable conditions, the microbiome reverses its symbiotic nature and affects growth and degrades the macroalgae by causing different diseases in different species. In parallel, marine macroalgae employ different defence mechanisms, a physical defence such as continuous shedding of the outer layer of cells, and the mucilaginous covering and chemical defence such as the production of secondary metabolites. The following chapter focuses on the macroalgal surface-associated microbiome and its defence system with a certain number of relevant examples from related literature on this subject.

AB  - Seaweed biomass cultivation predicates the quantity and quality of this biorefinery feedstock. Unfortunately, the seaweed growth rate and chemical content are hardly predictable and are affected by environmental factors, including epiphytic bacteria. We hypothesize that microbiome engineering can control the chemical composition of Ulva biomass. We show that the engineered Maribacter sp. and Roseovarius sp. consortium modulate Ulva mutabilis growth rate and photosynthate content of constituents relevant for bioethanol production. Although minimal growth was observed in the axenic cultures (0.04 mm day−1), Ulva mutabilis in a tripartite community showed a growth rate of 3.79 mm day−1 in the growth phase. Furthermore, the content of glucose and glycerol in Ulva of the engineered community increased by 77 ± 19% and 460 ± 207% whereas xylose and glucuronic acid decreased by 37 ± 14% and 46 ± 15% in comparison to axenic culture. Interestingly, bacterial addition affected the rhamnose/xylose/glucuronic acid ratio (1.96:1:1: vs 1.34:0.85:1 in xenic vs axenic culture), indicating the impact of bacteria on ulvan synthesis. In addition, tyrosine and histidine increased by 191 ± 61% and 40 ± 26%; however, valine, isoleucine, aspartate, threonine, serine, and phenylalanine decreased by 22 ± 19% - 42 ± 23%. Flux-balance analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium acetobutylicum was used to estimate the bioethanol yield from hydrolyzed Ulva biomass, in a one-step or two-step fermentation process. Simulation using S. cerevisiae (RN1016) with xylose isomerase resulted in a bioethanol yield of 85.62 for xenic vs. 71.31 mg/g dry weight (DW) axenic cultures of Ulva. The increased growth rate and the relative amounts of photosynthates of U. mutabilis are modulated by the engineered microbiome. Moreover, it results in biomass with a higher potential for bioethanol fermentation in comparison to axenic cultures.

AB  - The green seaweed Ulva (Chlorophyta) and its associated epibacterial microbiome form a functional holobiont that adapts to stress as a whole. As the macroalga provides carbon sources for bacteria and relies on algal growth and morphogenesis-promoting factors (AGMPF) released by bacteria, those cross-kingdom interactions are especially fascinating. We hypothesized that the Ulva holobionts from the warm-temperate Mediterranean-Atlantic and cold Antarctic habitats respond to cold stress differently depending on the production of highly polar low molecular weight compounds (LMWCs) with stress-regulating activity. We compared the microbiome of and metabolic changes in U. compressa (cultivar U. mutabilis), initially collected in Ria Formosa (Portugal), with that of U. bulbosa (strain AWI #1002) collected in Antarctica by performing a warm-cold temperature shift experiment. Microbiome analysis indicated significant differences between the two species and that the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was lower in cultivated U. bulbosa than in freshly isolated Ulva; despite this, AGMPF-producing bacteria were detected in both holobionts. Significant differences in metabolite profiles were observed between both species using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MS). Biomarkers such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and taurine were identified following a temperature shift from 18 °C to 5 °C in the warm-temperate U. mutabilis and the cold-adapted U. bulbosa, respectively. Our findings show that metabolic changes in the holobiont in response to cold are species-dependent. To evaluate the contribution of the metabolic changes of bacteria and algae to the stress response, the reductionistic model system of the tripartite community formed by U. mutabilis and its two essential bacteria, Roseovarius sp. strain MS2 and Maribacter sp. strain MS6, which release all essential AGMPFs, was investigated. We examined the production of polar LMWCs in the presence and absence of bacteria following a shift to cold temperatures. Among the metabolites studied, ectoine ((4S)-2-methyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid) was only detected in the presence of bacteria, highlighting the role of bacteria in releasing compounds that mitigate environmental stresses through cold stress adaptation factors (CSAF). Our findings suggest that microbiome engineering will allow us to improve macroalgae adaptability to stressful situations, which can be further applied to the sustainable management of (land-based) aquaculture systems.

AB  - The green seaweed Ulva is a model system to study seaweed–bacteria interactions, but the impact of environmental drivers on the dynamics of these interactions is little understood. In this study, we investigated the stability and variability of the seaweed-associated bacteria across the Atlantic–Baltic Sea salinity gradient. We characterized the bacterial communities of 15 Ulva sensu lato species along 2,000 km of coastline in a total of 481 samples. Our results demonstrate that the Ulva-associated bacterial composition was strongly structured by both salinity and host species (together explaining between 34% and 91% of the variation in the abundance of the different bacterial genera). The largest shift in the bacterial consortia coincided with the horohalinicum (5–8 PSU, known as the transition zone from freshwater to marine conditions). Low-salinity communities especially contained high relative abundances of Luteolibacter, Cyanobium, Pirellula, Lacihabitans and an uncultured Spirosomaceae, whereas high-salinity communities were predominantly enriched in Litorimonas, Leucothrix, Sulfurovum, Algibacter and Dokdonia. We identified a small taxonomic core community (consisting of Paracoccus, Sulfitobacter and an uncultured Rhodobacteraceae), which together contributed to 14% of the reads per sample, on average. Additional core taxa followed a gradient model, as more core taxa were shared between neighbouring salinity ranges than between ranges at opposite ends of the Atlantic–Baltic Sea gradient. Our results contradict earlier statements that Ulva-associated bacterial communities are taxonomically highly variable across individuals and largely stochastically defined. Characteristic bacterial communities associated with distinct salinity regions may therefore facilitate the host's adaptation across the environmental gradient.

AU  - Wichard, Thomas
T2  - Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology
T3  - Special Issue: Algal model organisms by Susana Coelho and Olivier de Clerck
AB  - The marine green macroalga Ulva (Chlorophyta, Ulvales), also known as sea lettuce, coexists with a diverse microbiome. Many Ulva species proliferate in nature and form green algal blooms (“green tides”), which can occur when nutrient-rich wastewater from agricultural or densely populated areas is flushed into the sea. Bacteria are necessary for the adhesion of Ulva to its substrate, its growth, and the development of its blade morphology. In the absence of certain bacteria, Ulva mutabilis develops into a callus-like morphotype. However, with the addition of the necessary marine bacteria, the entire morphogenesis can be restored. Surprisingly, just two bacteria isolated from U. mutabilis are sufficient for inducing morphogenesis and establishing the reductionist system of a tripartite community. While one bacterial strain causes algal blade cell division, another causes the differentiation of basal cells into a rhizoid and supports cell wall formation because of a low concentration of the morphogen thallusin (below 10-10 mol/L). This review focuses on the research conducted on this topic since 2015, discusses how U. mutabilis has developed into a model organism in chemical ecology, and explores the questions that have already been addressed and the perspectives that a reductionist model system allows. In particular, the field of systems biology will achieve a comprehensive, quantitative understanding of the dynamic interactions between Ulva and its associated bacteria to better predict the behavior of the system as a whole. The reductionist approach has enabled the study of the bacteria-induced morphogenesis of Ulva. Specific questions regarding the optimization of cultivation conditions as well as the yield of raw materials for the food and animal feed industries can be answered in the laboratory and through applied science. Genome sequencing, the improvement of genetic engineering tools, and the first promising attempts to leverage macroalgae–microbe interactions in aquaculture make this model organism, which has a comparatively short parthenogenetic life cycle, attractive for both fundamental and applied research. The reviewed research paves the way for the synthetic biology of macroalgae-associated microbiomes in sustainable aquacultures.

AB  - While microbiome alterations are increasingly proposed as a rapid mechanism to buffer organisms under changing environmental conditions, studies of these processes in the marine realm are lagging far behind their terrestrial counterparts. Here, we used a controlled laboratory experiment to examine whether the thermal tolerance of the brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma, a common species in European coastal ecosystems, could be enhanced by the repeated addition of bacteria from its natural environment. Juvenile algae from three genotypes were subjected for two weeks to a temperature gradient, spanning almost the entire thermal range that can be tolerated by the species (11–30 °C). At the start of the experiment and again in the middle of the experiment, the algae were inoculated with bacteria from their natural environment or left untouched as a control. Relative growth rate was measured over the two-week period, and we assessed bacterial community composition prior to and at the end of the experiment. Since the growth of D. dichotoma over the full thermal gradient was not affected by supplementing bacteria, our results indicate no scope for bacterial-mediated stress alleviation. The minimal changes in the bacterial communities linked to bacterial addition, particularly at temperatures above the thermal optimum (22–23 °C), suggest the existence of a barrier to bacterial recruitment. These findings indicate that ecological bacterial rescue is unlikely to play a role in mitigating the effects of ocean warming on this brown seaweed.

AB  - Axenic cultures of the green seaweed Ulva mutabilis were inoculated with bacteria providing essential algal growth and morphogenesis-promoting factors (AGMPFs) and were exposed to temperature shifts from 18 °C to 30 °C. The temperature-dependent effect of bacteria on longitudinal algal growth and the molecular composition of the chemosphere in the algal culture medium was explored. The reductionist tripartite model system of U. mutabilis , Roseovarius sp. MS2, and Maribacter sp. MS6 was applied as a reference and has been changed by substituting Roseovarius with isolates that phenocopy this strain. Rathayibacter festucae IH2 and Roseovarius aestuarii G8 boosted growth at 18 °C but slowed it down at 30 °C. Additional inoculation of Roseovarius sp. MS2 mitigated these adverse bacterial effects partially. At 30 °C, the molecular profile of the chemosphere differed dramatically between all tested tripartite communities, indicating different traits of the same bacterium with changing temperatures. Functional examinations should, therefore, accompany microbiome analysis to detect changing traits with the same microbiome composition.

AB  - Eukaryotic hosts are associated with microbial communities that are critical to their function. Microbiota manipulation using beneficial microorganisms, for example, in the form of animal probiotics or plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPMs), can enhance host performance and health. Recently, seaweed beneficial microorganisms (SBMs) have been identified that promote the growth and development and/or improve disease resistance of seaweeds. This knowledge coincides with global initiatives seeking to expand and intensify seaweed aquaculture. Here, we provide a pathway with the potential to improve commercial cultivation of seaweeds through microbiota manipulation, highlighting that seaweed restoration practices can also benefit from further understanding SBMs and their modes of action. The challenges and opportunities of different approaches to identify and apply SBMs to seaweed aquaculture are discussed.

AB  - The holobiont concept (i.e., multiple living beings in close symbiosis with one another and functioning as a unit) is revolutionizing our understanding of biology, especially in marine systems. The earliest marine holobiont was likely a syntrophic partnership of at least two prokaryotic members. Since then, symbiosis has enabled marine organisms to conquer all ocean habitats through the formation of holobionts with a wide spectrum of complexities. However, most scientific inquiries have focused on isolated organisms and their adaptations to specific environments. In this review, we attempt to illustrate why a holobiont perspective—specifically, the study of how numerous organisms form a discrete ecological unit through symbiosis—will be a more impactful strategy to advance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine life. We argue that this approach is instrumental in addressing the threats to marine biodiversity posed by the current global environmental crisis.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The brown alga Saccharina japonica (Areschoug) Lane, Mayes, Druehl et Saunders is a highly polymorphic representative of the family Laminariaceae, inhabiting the northwest Pacific region. We have obtained 16S rRNA sequence data in symbiont microorganisms of the typical form (TYP) of S. japonica and its common morphological varieties, known as “longipes” (LON) and “shallow-water” (SHA), which show contrasting bathymetric distribution and sharp morphological, life history traits, and ecological differences. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences shows that the microbial communities are significantly different in the three forms studied and consist of mosaic sets of common and form-specific bacterial lineages. The divergence in bacterial composition is substantial between the TYP and LON forms in spite of their high genetic similarity. The symbiont distribution in the S. japonica forms and in three other laminarialean species is not related to the depth or locality of the algae settlements. Combined with our previous results on symbiont associations in sea urchins and taking into account the highly specific character of bacteria-algae associations, we propose that the TYP and LON forms may represent incipient species passing through initial steps of reproductive isolation. We suggest that phenotype differences between genetically similar forms may be caused by host-symbiont interactions that may be a general feature of evolution in algae and other eukaryote organisms. Bacterial symbionts could serve as sensitive markers to distinguish genetically similar algae forms and also as possible growth-promoting inductors to increase algae productivity.

TI  - Holobiont Evolution: Population Theory for the Hologenome
AU  - Roughgarden, Joan
T2  - The American Naturalist
AB  - This article develops mathematical theory for the population dynamics of microbiomes with their hosts and for holobiont evolution caused by holobiont selection. The objective is to account for the formation of microbiome-host integration. Microbial population dynamic parameters must mesh with the host’s for coexistence. A horizontally transmitted microbiome is a genetic system with “collective inheritance.” The microbial source pool in the environment corresponds to the gamete pool for nuclear genes. Poisson sampling of the microbial source pool corresponds to binomial sampling of the gamete pool. However, holobiont selection on the microbiome does not lead to a counterpart of the Hardy-Weinberg law or to directional selection that always fixes microbial genes conferring the highest holobiont fitness. A microbe might strike an optimal fitness balance between lowering its within-host fitness while increasing holobiont fitness. Such microbes are replaced by otherwise identical microbes that contribute nothing to holobiont fitness. This replacement can be reversed by hosts that initiate immune responses to nonhelpful microbes. This discrimination leads to microbial species sorting. Host-orchestrated species sorting followed by microbial competition, rather than coevolution or multilevel selection, is predicted to be the cause of microbiome-host integration.

TI  - Host Biology in Light of the Microbiome: Ten Principles of Holobionts and Hologenomes
AU  - Bordenstein, Seth R.
AU  - Theis, Kevin R.
T2  - PLOS Biology
AB  - Groundbreaking research on the universality and diversity of microorganisms is now challenging the life sciences to upgrade fundamental theories that once seemed untouchable. To fully appreciate the change that the field is now undergoing, one has to place the epochs and foundational principles of Darwin, Mendel, and the modern synthesis in light of the current advances that are enabling a new vision for the central importance of microbiology. Animals and plants are no longer heralded as autonomous entities but rather as biomolecular networks composed of the host plus its associated microbes, i.e., "holobionts." As such, their collective genomes forge a "hologenome," and models of animal and plant biology that do not account for these intergenomic associations are incomplete. Here, we integrate these concepts into historical and contemporary visions of biology and summarize a predictive and refutable framework for their evaluation. Specifically, we present ten principles that clarify and append what these concepts are and are not, explain how they both support and extend existing theory in the life sciences, and discuss their potential ramifications for the multifaceted approaches of zoology and botany. We anticipate that the conceptual and evidence-based foundation provided in this essay will serve as a roadmap for hypothesis-driven, experimentally validated research on holobionts and their hologenomes, thereby catalyzing the continued fusion of biology's subdisciplines. At a time when symbiotic microbes are recognized as fundamental to all aspects of animal and plant biology, the holobiont and hologenome concepts afford a holistic view of biological complexity that is consistent with the generally reductionist approaches of biology.

TI  - Probiotics in aquaculture: a promising emerging alternative approach
AU  - Chauhan, Arun

T2  - Symbiosis
AB  - Aquaculture is an important food producing sector to fulfill nutritional food demand of a continuously growing population. However, disease outbreak has become a major problem in aquaculture which cause huge economic loss to aquaculture industries. The use of expensive chemotherapeutic drugs for treatment have negative impacts on the aquatic environment. So there is a growing concern to find other safe, non-antibiotic based and eco-friendly alternative for the treatment of the diseases. The use of probiotics is a promising alternative approach for the control of infectious agents and treatment of diseases. The benefits of probiotic include stimulation of growth, improved digestion, enhanced immune response and recuperate the water quality as well. Probiotics concoct the fish to fight against various pathogens and improves the overall health as they show anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties. The use of probiotics in aquaculture is a recent trend and its efficacy in aquatic environment has not been studied extensively. This review paper provides the current knowledge of the use of probiotics in aquaculture, selection criteria, types of probiotics used in aquaculture, their mode of action and administrative methods of probiotics in aquaculture.

T2  - Trends in Microbiology
AB  - When studying the effects of climate change on eukaryotic organisms we often oversee a major ecological process: the interaction with microbes. Eukaryotic hosts and microbes form functional units, termed holobionts, where microbes play crucial roles in host functioning. Environmental stress may disturb these complex mutualistic relations. Macroalgae form the foundation of coastal ecosystems worldwide and provide important ecosystem services – services they could likely not provide without their microbial associates. Still, today we do not know how environmental stress will affect the macroalgal holobiont in an increasingly changing ocean. In this review, we provide a conceptual framework that contributes to understanding the different levels at which the holobiont and environment interact, and we suggest a manipulative experimental approach as a guideline for future research.

AB  - Different marine seaweed species have been shown to harbour specific bacterial communities, however, the extent to which vertical symbiont transmission from parents to offspring contributes to host-specificity is unclear. Here we use fluorescence and electron microscopy as well as 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis to investigate symbiont transmission in members of the three major seaweed groups (green Chlorophyta, red Rhodophyta and brown Phaeophyceae). We found seaweeds employ diverse strategies to transfer symbionts to their progeny. For instance, the green Ulva australis does not appear to have the capacity for vertical transmission. In contrast, the brown Phyllospora comosa adopts a non-selective vertical transmission. The red Delisea pulchra demonstrates weak selectivity in symbiont transmission, while the brown Hormosira banksii exhibits a strongly selective symbiont transfer. Mucilage on the gametes appears to facilitate vertical transmission and transferred bacteria have predicted properties that could support early development of the seaweeds. Previous meta-analysis has indicated that vertical transmission is rare in aquatic compared to terrestrial environments, however, our results contribute to the growing evidence that this might not be the case and that instead vertical transmission with various degrees of symbiont selection occurs in the ecologically important group of seaweeds.

T2  - Frontiers in Microbiology
AB  - Ulva spp., one of the most important providers of marine ecosystem services, has gained substantial attention lately in both ecological and applicational aspects. It is known that macroalgae and their associated microbial community form an inseparable unit whose intimate relationship can affect the wellbeing of both. Different cultivation systems, such as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), are assumed to impact Ulva bacterial community significantly in terms of compositional guilds. However, in such a highly dynamic environment, it is crucial to determine how the community dynamics change over time. In the current study, we characterized the microbiota associated with Ulva fasciata grown as a biofilter in an IMTA system in the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat, Israel) over a developmental period of 5 weeks. The Ulva-associated microbial community was identified using the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, and ecological indices were further analyzed. The Ulva-associated microbiome revealed a swift change in composition along the temporal succession, with clusters of distinct communities for each timepoint. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Deinococcus-Thermus, the most abundant phyla that accounted for up to 95% of all the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) found, appeared in all weeks. Further analyses highlighted microbial biomarkers representing each timepoint and their characteristics. Finally, the presence of highly abundant species in Ulva microbiota yet underestimated in previous research (such as phyla Deinococcus-Thermus, families Saprospiraceae, Thiohalorhabdaceae, and Pirellulaceae) suggests that more attention should be paid to the temporal succession of the assembly of microbes inhabiting macroalgae in aquaculture, in general, and IMTA, in particular. Characterizing bacterial communities associated with Ulva fasciata from an IMTA system provided a better understanding of their associated microbial dynamics and revealed this macroalgae's adaptation to such a habitat.

AB  - Although the effects of certain species of seaweed on the microbial community structure have long been a research focus in marine ecology, the response of the microbial community to seasons and different seaweed species is poorly understood. In the present study, a total of 39 seawater samples were collected during 3 months from three zones: Neoporphyra haitanensis cultivation zones (P), Gracilaria lemaneiformis-Saccharina japonica mixed cultivation zones (G), and control zones (C). These samples were then analyzed using 18S and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to ascertain the fungal and bacterial communities, respectively, along with the determination of environmental factors. Our results showed that increased dissolved oxygen (DO), decreased inorganic nutrients, and released dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seaweed cultivation zone predominantly altered the variability of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial communities. Certain microbial groups such as Aurantivirga, Pseudomonas, and Woeseia were stimulated and enriched in response to seaweed cultivation, and the enriched microorganisms varied across seaweed cultivation zones due to differences in the composition of released DOM. In addition, seasonal changes in salinity and temperature were strongly correlated with microbial community composition and structure. Our study provides new insights into the interactions between seaweed and microbial communities.

AB  - Seaweeds of the intertidal regions are a rich source of surface associated bacteria and are potential source of antimicrobial molecules. In the present study, 77 epiphytic isolates from eight different algae collected from Little Andaman were enumerated. On testing for their antimicrobial activities against certain pathogens twelve isolates showed positive and six of them showed significant antimicrobial inhibition zone against Shigella boydii type 1, Shigella flexneri type 2a, Shigella dysenteriae type 5, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O115, Enteropathogenic E. coli serotype O114, Vibrio cholera; O1 Ogawa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus. Based on the activity these six isolates (G1C, G2C, G3C, UK, UVAD, and Tor1) were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence and were found to belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Purified antimicrobial compounds obtained from these isolates were identified by GC-MS. Furan derivatives were identified from G2C Pseudomonas stutzeri KJ849834, UVAD Alcanivorax dieselolei KJ849833, UK Vibrio sp. KJ849837, Tor1 Exiguobacterium profundum KJ849838. While 2-Pyrrolidinone, Phenol, 2, 4-bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl) were from G3C Vibrio owensii KJ849836 and (1-Allylcyclopropyl) methanol from the extracts of G1C Bacillus sp. KJ849835. The results of the present study shows that these six potent isolates isolated from the seaweeds are found to be a source of antimicrobial compounds.

AB  - Seaweed associated bacteria can be exploited for sustainable production and conservation of seaweeds, although limited information exists in several coastal waters in West Africa. Here, the diversity and abundance of bacteria on five seaweeds, Sargassum vulgare, Padina durvillaei, Hydropuntia dentata, Hypnea musciformis and Ulva fasciata, and surrounding seawaters across five coastal sites in the Central and Western regions of Ghana were investigated. Biochemical tests and MALDIâ€“TOF identification system were used to determine the bacteria diversity and abundance on the seaweeds and seawater. A total of 530 bacterial isolates, belonging to 28 species (and mostly Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) were identified. A higher diversity of bacteria species was found associated with the seaweeds (83%) than in seawater (17%). Bacterial composition was similar among taxonomically-related seaweeds. The brown (S. vulgare) and red (H. musciformis) seaweeds recorded the most and least diverse bacterial assemblage, respectively. Seasonally, bacterial diversity and abundance were marginally higher in the wet season. The study provides important baseline information on the spatial, temporal and taxonomic distribution of bacteria associated with commercially valuable seaweed species in the coastal areas of Ghana. The results are also important for the sustainable exploitation and conservation of these important macroalgae in Ghana and elsewhere.

AB  - Interrelations between epiphytic bacteria and macroalgae are multifaceted and complicated, though little is known about the community structure, interaction and functions of those epiphytic bacteria. This study comprehensively characterized the epiphytic bacterial communities associated with eight different common seaweeds collected from a rocky intertidal zone on the Indian Ocean at Cape Vidal, South Africa. High-throughput sequencing analyses indicated that seaweed-associated bacterial communities were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed the presence of elemental composition in the surface of examined seaweeds, in varying concentrations. Cluster analysis showed that bacterial communities of brown seaweeds (SW2 and SW4) were closely resembled those of green seaweeds (SW1) and red seaweeds (SW7) while those of brown seaweeds formed a separate branch. Predicted functional capabilities of epiphytic bacteria using PICRUSt analysis revealed abundance of genes related to metabolic and biosynthetic activities. Further important identified functional interactions included genes for bacterial chemotaxis, which could be responsible for the observed association and network of elemental-microbes interaction. The study concludes that the diversity of epiphytic bacteria on seaweed surfaces is greatly influenced by algal organic exudates as well as elemental deposits on their surfaces, which triggers chemotaxis responses from epiphytic bacteria with the requisite genes to metabolise those substrates.

However, there is still incomplete understanding of this epiphytic bacteria-host algae interactions. This study comprehensively analysed variation of the epiphytic bacterial communities (EBC) composition of red macroalga Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis at different geographic locations and environmental factors (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus), which shape the EBC composition of G. lemaneiformis. The composition and structure of EBC were characterized using high throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The results revealed that epiphytic bacteria varied significantly among three different geographic locations in China, i.e., Nan’ao Island (NA), Lianjiang County (LJ), and Nanri Island (NR). Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and Epsilonbacteraeota at NR were strongly positively correlated with total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), but negatively correlated with nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N). The relative abundance of Cyanobacteria at NA and LJ were strongly positively correlated with NO2-N, but negatively correlated with TN, TP, NO3-N, and DIN. Besides, the Mantel test results indicated that the EBC composition was significantly correlated with these environmental factors, which was also confirmed by Spearman correlation analysis. Thus, environmental factors such as NO3-N and DIN play a key role in the community composition of epiphytic bacteria on G. lemaneiformis. This study provides important baseline knowledge on the community composition of epiphytic bacteria on G. lemaneiformis and shows correlation between different epiphytic bacteria and their surrounding environmental factors.

TI  - Metabolomics and Microbiomics Insights into Differential Surface Fouling of Three Macroalgal Species of Fucus (Fucales, Phaeophyceae) That Co-Exist in the German Baltic Sea

AB  - The brown algal genus Fucus provides essential ecosystem services crucial for marine environments. Macroalgae (seaweeds) release dissolved organic matter, hence, are under strong settlement pressure from micro- and macrofoulers. Seaweeds are able to control surface epibionts directly by releasing antimicrobial compounds onto their surfaces, and indirectly by recruiting beneficial microorganisms that produce antimicrobial/antifouling metabolites. In the Kiel Fjord, in the German Baltic Sea, three distinct Fucus species coexist: F. vesiculosus, F. serratus, and F. distichus subsp. evanescens. Despite sharing the same habitat, they show varying fouling levels; F. distichus subsp. evanescens is the least fouled, while F. vesiculosus is the most fouled. The present study explored the surface metabolomes and epiphytic microbiota of these three Fucus spp., aiming to uncover the factors that contribute to the differences in the fouling intensity on their surfaces. Towards this aim, algal surface metabolomes were analyzed using comparative untargeted LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics, to identify the marker metabolites influencing surface fouling. Their epiphytic microbial communities were also comparatively characterized using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, to pinpoint the differences in the surface microbiomes of the algae. Our results show that the surface of the least fouling species, F. distichus subsp. evanescens, is enriched with bioactive compounds, such as betaine lipids MGTA, 4-pyridoxic acid, and ulvaline, which are absent from the other species. Additionally, it exhibits a high abundance of the fungal genera Mucor and Alternaria, along with the bacterial genus Yoonia-Loktanella. These taxa are known for producing antimicrobial/antifouling compounds, suggesting their potential role in the observed fouling resistance on the surface of the F. distichus subsp. evanescens compared to F. serratus and F. vesiculosus. These findings provide valuable clues on the differential surface fouling intensity of Fucus spp., and their importance in marine chemical defense and fouling dynamics.

AB  - The brown alga Fucus vesiculosus is a keystone marine species, which is subject to heavy surface colonisation. This study was designed to analyse the surface epibiome of F. vesiculosus in conjunction with the composition and spatial distribution of its surface metabolome. The amplicon sequencing, SEM and CARD-FISH imaging studies showed Alphaproteobacteria to predominate the epibiotic bacteria. Fungi of the class Eurotiomycetes were visualised for the first time on an algal surface. An untargeted metabolomics approach using molecular networks, in silico prediction and manual dereplication showed the differential metabolome of the surface and the whole tissue extracts. In total, 50 compounds were putatively dereplicated by UPLC-MS/MS, 37 of which were previously reported from both seaweeds and microorganisms. Untargeted spatial metabolomics by DESI-Imaging MS identified the specific localisation and distribution of various primary and secondary metabolites on surface imprints and in algal cross sections. The UPLC-MS, DESI-IMS and NMR analyses failed to confirm the presence of any surface-associated metabolite, except for mannitol, which were previously reported from F. vesiculosus. This is the first study analysing the seaweed surface microbiome in conjunction with untargeted surface metabolomics and spatial metabolomics approaches.

AB  - An integrative multi-omics approach allowed monthly variations for a year of the surface metabolome and the epibacterial community of the Mediterranean Phaeophyceae Taonia atomaria to be investigated. The LC–MS-based metabolomics and 16S rDNA metabarcoding data sets were integrated in a multivariate meta-omics analysis (multi-block PLS-DA from the MixOmic DIABLO analysis) showing a strong seasonal covariation (Mantel test: p < 0.01). A network based on positive and negative correlations between the two data sets revealed two clusters of variables, one relative to the ‘spring period’ and a second to the ‘summer period’. The ‘spring period’ cluster was mainly characterized by dipeptides positively correlated with a single bacterial taxon of the Alteromonadaceae family (BD1-7 clade). Moreover, ‘summer’ dominant epibacterial taxa from the second cluster (including Erythrobacteraceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Oceanospirillaceae and Flammeovirgaceae) showed positive correlations with few metabolites known as macroalgal antifouling defences [e.g. dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and proline] which exhibited a key role within the correlation network. Despite a core community that represents a significant part of the total epibacteria, changes in the microbiota structure associated with surface metabolome variations suggested that both environment and algal host shape the bacterial surface microbiota.

AB  - Due to ocean acidification and global warming, surface seawater of the western Baltic Sea is expected to reach an average of ∼1100 μatm pCO2 and an increase of ∼5°C by the year 2100. In four consecutive experiments (spanning 10–11 weeks each) in all seasons within 1 year, the abiotic factors temperature (+5°C above in situ) and pCO2 (adjusted to ∼1100 μatm) were tested for their single and combined effects on epibacterial communities of the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus and on bacteria present in the surrounding seawater. The experiments were set up in three biological replicates using the Kiel Outdoor Benthocosm facility (Kiel, Germany). Phylogenetic analyses of the respective microbiota were performed by bacterial 16S (V1-V2) rDNA Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing after 0, 4, 8, and 10/11 weeks per season. The results demonstrate (I) that the bacterial community composition varied in time and (II) that relationships between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within an OTU association network were mainly governed by the habitat. (III) Neither single pCO2 nor pCO2:Temperature interaction effects were statistically significant. However, significant impact of ocean warming was detected varying among seasons. (IV) An indicator OTU (iOTU) analysis identified several iOTUs that were strongly influenced by temperature in spring, summer, and winter. In the warming treatments of these three seasons, we observed decreasing numbers of bacteria that are commonly associated with a healthy marine microbial community and—particularly during spring and summer—an increase in potentially pathogenic and bacteria related to intensified microfouling. This might lead to severe consequences for the F. vesiculosus holobiont finally affecting the marine ecosystem.

AB  - Genetic variation in a foundation species may affect the composition of associated communities as well as modify ecosystem function. While the ecological consequences of genetic diversity of foundation species have been widely reported, the ability of individual genotypes to support dissimilar communities has been documented only in forest ecosystems. Here, for the first time in a marine ecosystem, we test whether the different genotypes of the rockweed Fucus vesiculosus harbor distinct community phenotypes and whether the genetic similarity of individual genotypes or their defensive compound content can explain the variation of the associated communities. We reared replicated genotypes in a common garden in the sea and analyzed their associated communities of periphytic algae and invertebrates as well as determined their contents of defense compounds, phlorotannins, and genetic distance based on neutral molecular markers. The periphytic community was abundant in mid-summer and its biovolume, diversity and community composition varied among the rockweed genotypes. The diversity of the periphytic community decreased with its increasing biovolume. In autumn, when grazers were abundant, periphytic community biomass was lower and less variable among rockweed genotypes, indicating different relative importance of bottom-up regulation through heritable variation of the foundation species and top-down regulation through grazing intensity. Similarly, composition of the invertebrate community varied among the rockweed genotypes. Although the genotype explained about 10–18% of the variation in associated communities, the variation was explained neither by the genetic distance nor the phlorotannin content. Thus, neither neutral genetic markers nor a single phenotypic trait could provide a mechanistic understanding of the genetic basis of community specificity. Therefore, a more comprehensive mapping of quantitative trait variation is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. The community specificity implies that genetic variation within a foundation species is crucial for the biodiversity and assembly of associated organisms and, thus, for the functioning of associated communities. The result highlights the importance of ensuring the genetic variation of foundation species as a conservation target.

AB  - Perennial macroalgae within the genus Fucus are known to exude metabolites through their outer thallus surface. Some of these metabolites have pro- and/or antifouling properties. Seasonal fluctuations of natural fouling pressure and chemical fouling control strength against micro- and macrofoulers have previously been observed in Fucus, suggesting that control strength varies with threat. To date, a study on the seasonal composition of surface associated metabolites, responsible for much of the fouling control, has not been done. We sampled individuals of the two co-occurring species F. vesiculosus and F. serratus at monthly intervals (six per species and month) during a one-year field study. We analysed the chemical composition of surface associated metabolites of both Fucus species by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to describe temporal patterns in chemical surface composition. Additionally, we correlated abiotic and biotic parameters recorded monthly within the sampled habitat with the variation in the chemical surface landscape of Fucus. Our study revealed that the chemical surface composition of both Fucus species exhibits substantial seasonal differences between spring/summer and autumn/winter months. Light and temperature explained most of the seasonal variability in surface metabolite composition of both Fucus species. A strong summerly up-regulation of eighteen saccharides and two hydroxy acids in F. vesiculosus as well as of four fatty acids and two saccharides in F. serratus was observed. We discuss how these up-regulated molecules may have a complex effect on associated microfoulers, both promoting or decreasing fouling depending on metabolite and bacterial identity. These seasonal shifts in the surface metabolome seem to exert a compound control of density and composition of the Fucus associated biofilm.

AB  - The holopelagic brown macroalgae Sargassum natans and Sargassum fluitans form essential habitats for attached and mobile fauna which contributes to a unique biodiversity in the Atlantic Ocean. However, holopelagic Sargassum natans (genotype I & VIII) and Sargassum fluitans (genotype III) have begun forming large accumulations with subsequent strandings on the western coast of Africa, the Caribbean and northern Brazil, threatening local biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and triggering economic losses. Moreover, stranded masses of holopelagic Sargassum may introduce or facilitate growth of bacteria that are not normally abundant in coastal regions where Sargassum is washing ashore. Hitherto, it is not clear how the holopelagic Sargassum microbiome varies across its growing biogeographic range and what factors drive the microbial composition. We determined the microbiome associated with holopelagic Sargassum from the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt to coastal stranding sites in Mexico and Florida. We characterized the Sargassum microbiome via amplicon sequencing of the 16S V4 region hypervariable region of the rRNA gene. The microbial community of holopelagic Sargassum was mainly composed of photo(hetero)trophs, organic matter degraders and potentially pathogenic bacteria from the Pseudomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Vibrionaceae. Sargassum genotypes S. natans I, S. natans VIII and S. fluitans III contained similar microbial families, but relative abundances and diversity varied. LEfSE analyses further indicated biomarker genera that were indicative of Sargassum S. natans I/VIII and S. fluitans III. The holopelagic Sargassum microbiome showed biogeographic patterning with high relative abundances of Vibrio spp., but additional work is required to determine whether that represents health risks in coastal environments. Our study informs coastal management policy, where the adverse sanitary effects of stranded Sargassum might impact the health of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Aim: To explore seaweed-associated bacteria as prospective producers of bioactive material with antibacterial properties. Materials & methods: 143 bacterial species were isolated from the surface of 15 New Zealand marine macroalgae. Bacterial extracts obtained using dimethyl sulfoxide and ethyl acetate were screened for antagonistic activities against three antimicrobial susceptibility indicators: Kocuria rhizophila, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, using well-diffusion method. For selected species, minimum inhibitory concentration was determined, followed by a phylogenetic identification based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results: Among all bacteria screened, seven that belonged to the genera Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Psychromonas and Cobetia, showed antagonistic activity against all three indicators. Conclusion: Seaweed-associated bacteria produce bioactive compounds with antimicrobial potential and possible biomedical application in aquatic habitats.

AB  - Diseases of the commercially cultivated brown seaweed Saccharina japonica have been noticed since the 1960s in China. However, the usually opportunistic nature of the pathogenic bacteria of seaweeds is still a main obstacle for isolating and identifying pathogenic bacteria responsible for causing diseases of the cultivated S. japonica. In this study, a Gram-positive bacterium XP-2 was isolated from the abnormal diseased mature sporophytes of S. japonica. Pathogenicity test indicated that XP-2 could cause green-rotten disease in healthy juvenile sporophytes and significant algal ultrastructural changes were observed after S. japonica was infected by XP-2. The cells shrank, and the thylakoids of the chloroplasts became blurred after 12 h of re-infection. At 24 h slight deformation was observed in the structure of the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and nucleus. There also were many vacuoles in the infected cells. After 31 h of re-infection, mitochondrial structure and thylakoids became more indistinct. SEM and TEM observations indicated that XP-2 was rod-shaped with no flagella. Analysis of the full length 16S rRNA gene sequence and physiological and chemical characteristics indicated that XP-2 was closely related to Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans 12280 T. Based on these results, XP-2 was designated Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans XP-2. The pathogenicity of E. oxidotolerans XP-2 was identified by Koch’s Postulate under laboratory conditions. These results enrich the growing list of pathogenic bacteria in commercially cultivated seaweeds and also provide a foundation for investigating the virulence mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria of commercially cultivated seaweeds in the near future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Commercially farmed Saccharina japonica suffers from various diseases during its cultivation. Isolation and identification of the causative agents are crucial for the diagnosis and control of the diseases. In this study, an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium was isolated from healthy matured S. japonica and was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa MSLj6–25. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa MSLj6–25 was tested by the infection assay. Microscopic observations indicated that P. aeruginosa MSLj6–25 can cause green-rotten disease. Ultrastructural changes showed that the chloroplasts and the nucleus became condensed at 7 h after infection, while at 24 h, the chloroplasts and the nucleus were deformed. Colonies of P. aeruginosa MSLj6–25 were found to be flat and bright yellow. The bacterial cells were rod shaped with a single polar flagellum. MSLj6–25 had the highest similarity of 99.93% with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain CZ-45 by comparing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Combining biochemical characterization, we identified the taxonomic classification of MSLj6–25. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that P. aeruginosa was identified as an opportunistic pathogen in S. japonica. These results contribute to the baseline knowledge of pathogenic bacteria in S. japonica and lay the foundation for disease diagnosis and control.

AB  - Disease in the marine environment is predicted to increase with anthropogenic stressors and already affects major habitat-formers, such as corals and seaweeds. Solutions to address this issue are urgently needed. The seaweed Delisea pulchra is prone to a bleaching disease, which is caused by opportunistic pathogens and involves bacterial dysbiosis. Bacteria that can inhibit these pathogens and/or counteract dysbiosis are therefore hypothesised to reduce disease. This study aimed to identify such disease-protective bacteria and investigate their protective action. One strain, Phaeobacter sp. BS52, isolated from healthy D. pulchra, was antagonistic towards bleaching pathogens and significantly increased the proportion of healthy individuals when applied before the pathogen challenge (pathogen-only vs. BS52 + pathogen: 41–80%), and to a level similar to the control. However, no significant negative correlations between the relative abundances of pathogens and BS52 on D. pulchra were detected. Instead, inoculation of BS52 mitigated pathogen-induced changes in the epibacterial community. These observations suggest that the protective activity of BS52 was due to its ability to prevent dysbiosis, rather than direct pathogen inhibition. This study demonstrates the feasibility of manipulating bacterial communities in seaweeds to reduce disease and that mitigation of dysbiosis can have positive health outcomes.

AB  - Bacteria are one of the causes of green rot disease (GRD) in Saccharina japonica mariculture, which may lead to complete failure of seedling production. However, the association between bacterial community and host disease severity remains largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, the bacterial communities associated with GRD-infected seedlings with naturally varying disease severity from two seedling hatcheries in Northern China were analyzed to investigate the interactions between bacterial communities and GRD. The results indicated incorrect nutrient supply in both sites. Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were prevalent in all samples. Significant structural alterations were detected for epibacterial communities, which were further evidenced by differently abundant bacterial taxa associated with seedlings with varying disease severity. The predicted pathways of bacterial adhesion and antimicrobial compounds biosynthesis were significantly enriched in less severely diseased seedlings, whereas glutathione metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis were significantly increased in more severely diseased seedlings. The predicted categories of a two-component system, flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, and biofilm formation were significantly enriched in the bacterioplankton in more severely infected seawater. The differential bacterial community compositions and predicted functions provide new clues to elucidate the mechanism underlying the interaction between GRD occurrence and bacterial communities.

AB  - Recent bacterial induced bleaching disease events of the commercially farmed brown seaweed Saccharina japonica has resulted in significant reduction in healthy sporeling supply. However, to date the host associated epimicrobial community shifts with the disease progression have not been characterized. We investigated the dynamic shifts in the composition of the epibacterial communities of S. japonica with disease progression using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that the alpha diversity was significantly higher in the control group than in the infected group over disease progression (P < 0.01). There was a significant shift in the composition and predicted functions of the epibacterial communities in both control and infected groups. Indicator species, belonging to Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas and Sphingomona were significantly higher in the control group than infected group, suggesting that these taxa are associated with healthy S. japonica. In contrast, Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas and Colwellia were keystone taxa in the infected group at 24 h, and thus maybe considered to be the secondary opportunistic pathogens. Our study describes the changes of epibacterial communities associated with the progression of bleaching disease in S. japonica. This new information not only extends our baseline knowledge of the S. japonica epimicrobiome, but also paves the way for developing measures to mitigate disease outbreaks for the sustainable aquaculture of S. japonica.

AB  - Despite an increasing awareness of disease impacts on both cultivated and native seaweed populations, the development of marine probiotics has been limited and predominately focused on farmed animals. Bleaching (loss of thallus pigmentation) is one of the most prevalent diseases observed in marine macroalgae. Endemic probiotic bacteria have been characterized to prevent bleaching disease in red macroalgae Agarophyton vermiculophyllum and Delisea pulchra; however, the extent to which probiotic strains provide cross-protection to non-endemic hosts and the influence of native microbiota remain unknown. Using A. vermiculophyllum as a model, we demonstrate that co-inoculation with the pathogen Pseudoalteromonas arctica G-MAN6 and D. pulchra probiotic strain Phaeobacter sp. BS52 or Pseudoalteromonas sp. PB2-1 reduced the disease risks compared to the pathogen only treatment. Moreover, non-endemic probiotics outperformed the endemic probiotic strain Ralstonia sp. G-NY6 in the presence of the host natural microbiota. This study highlights how the native microbiota can impact the effectiveness of marine probiotics and illustrates the potential of harnessing probiotics that can function across different hosts to mitigate the impact of emerging marine diseases.

AB  - Malformation disease (MD) is one of the major constraints in the mariculture of the commercially important seaweed Saccharina japonica, which can cause severe losses of the kelp seedlings in the production process. However, the pathogenesis of MD remains largely undetermined. In this study, using cultivation experiments under laboratory conditions, MD severity was estimated for the young sporophytes of S. japonica, which were separately cultivated under different treatment conditions, including light intensity, duration of light exposure, and maturity level of the parent kelp. The associations between MD severity and epibacterial community divergence and assembly patterns were characterized. Higher MD severity significantly correlated with longer light exposure, and with both unmatured and overmatured parent kelp. The bacterial classes γ-Proteobacteria and α-Proteobacteria dominated all samples, but different MD severities were associated with different epibacterial communities. Comparisons of predicted functions for epibacterial communities revealed that longer light exposure led to a depletion in development and regeneration, while overmatured parent kelp resulted in a depletion in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism. Functional comparisons of the epibacterial communities between normal and unmatured parent kelp-generated seedlings revealed significantly different categories related to metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular processes, drug resistance, and bacterial infection. The significantly different pathways between groups, notably those related to bacterial infection and cellular processes, were partly consistent with the differences in bacterial compositions. The assembly of epiphytic bacterial communities was predominately governed by deterministic processes, and less impact was determined when there was significantly higher MD severity except when using overmatured parent kelp. Co-occurrence networks of the epibacterial communities associated with higher MD severity contained fewer nodes and exhibited lower modularity, but had higher graph density and degrees compared with those of seedlings with lower MD severity, indicating more complicated interactions. Nesterenkonia, Glycocaulis, Halomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomonas, Loktanella, and Cobetia were frequently determined keystone taxa in communities associated with higher MD severity. The present study enhances our understanding of the factors significantly associated with MD severity and the potential roles of epimicrobiome in determining the disease severity, which will be useful for disease management in the future.

AB  - Invasive species such as seaweeds often have a broad tolerance, allowing them to colonize novel habitats. During invasion, also new epibacteria can be formed on seaweeds, which have important chemo-ecological effects. Since UV-radiation (UVR) is one of the main factors affecting seaweeds and their epibacteria, we tested its effect on intertidal and subtidal thalli of the invasive seaweed Codium fragile from three sites and monitored photosynthesis, antioxidant activity and epibacteria. Exposure to UV-radiation resulted in photoinhibition with a subsequent low recovery in subtidal thalli from 23°S compared to 27°S and 30°S, which both showed a higher and almost complete recovery. However, a high antioxidant activity was present in all thalli, permitting to explain its relatively high tolerance to new environments. UV-radiation modified the composition of the epibacteria community by reducing its diversity and evenness. Our results showed that C. fragile responds plastic to variable UV-radiation (depending on site and water depth), which contributes to its high invasion potential.

AB  - Simple Summary
Bleaching disease frequently occurs at the late nursery stage in the farmed brown alga Saccharina japonica with Pseudoalteromonas piscicida X-8 (PpX-8) having been identified as a pathogenic bacterium. However, whether PpX-8 can trigger active defense responses in S. japonica via programmed cell death still remains unknown. In this study, PpX-8 extracellular compounds were more pathogenic (p < 0.05) before being heated, indicating that the virulence factors of PpX-8 may exist in its extracellular compounds and that they are heat-sensitive. Based on the typical morphological changes and biochemical characteristics of 3′-OH ends resulting from DNA cleavage, as well as the enzymatic activity of caspase-3-like protein, PpX-8 extracellular compounds induced programmed cell death and thus triggered active defense responses in farmed S. japonica. The results of this work indicate that seaweeds and higher plants are conservative in their active defense responses when facing pathogenic bacterial infection, and lay the foundation for further investigation of the virulence mechanisms of PpX-8.

Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria can trigger active defense responses in higher plants, leading to hypersensitive programmed cell death (PCD) to against those bacteria. However, related research on seaweeds is very limited. Pseudoalteromonas piscicida X-8 (PpX-8) has been identified as the pathogen that causes bleaching disease in commercially farmed Saccharina japonica. In this study, using an inoculation assay and microscopic observations, we found that the proportion of bleaching tissue pieces inoculated with PpX-8 extracellular compounds was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that inoculated with heated extracellular compounds, indicating that the virulence factors of PpX-8 exist in extracellular compounds and they are heat-sensitive. Using TEM, we observed typical morphological characteristics of PCD after inoculation with extracellular compounds, including chloroplast shrinkage, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and intact mitochondrial structures. Moreover, we detected biochemical characteristics of PCD, such as 3′-OH ends resulting from DNA cleavage and caspase-3-like enzymatic activity, using a TUNEL assay and fluorescence staining. Therefore, PpX-8 extracellular compounds can induce PCD, thus triggering active defense responses in S. japonica. These results indicate that seaweeds and higher plants are conservative in their active defense responses against pathogenic bacteria. The results of this study lay the foundation for further investigation of the virulence mechanisms of PpX-8.

AB  - A newly identified bacterial disease of kelp (Saccharina japonica) gametophytes was found in clone cultures. It is characterized by swollen gametophyte cells in the early period of infection followed by filamentous fading. An alginolytic marine bacterium referred to as A-1 was isolated from the diseased gametophytes. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing and morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics, the bacterium was identified as a strain of the genus Alteromonas. By testing Koch’s postulates, Alteromonas sp. A-1 was further confirmed as the pathogen. The infection process was also investigated using both scanning electron and light microscopy.

AB  - Macroalgae are important ecosystem engineers in temperate marine waters. The function of macroalgae is intimately linked to the composition and structure of their epibiotic bacterial, communities, and evidence has emerged that bacteria can also have a negative impact on their host by causing disease. A few examples exist where bacteria have been unambiguously linked to macroalgal disease, however in many cases, pathogenicity has not been clearly separated from saprophytic behaviour or secondary colonization after disease initiation. Nevertheless, pathogenic pressure by bacteria might be substantial, as macroalgae have evolved a range of innate and induced defence mechanism that have the potential to control bacterial attacks. The presence and abundance of virulence factors in marine bacteria, which have not previously been recognized as pathogens, also represents an underappreciated, opportunistic potential for disease. Given that virulence expression in opportunistic pathogens is often dependent on environmental conditions, we predict that current and future anthropogenic changes in the marine environment will lead to an increase in the occurrence of macroalgal disease. This review highlights important areas of research that require future attention to understand the link between environmental change, opportunistic pathogens and macroalgal health in the world's oceans.

AB  - Disease is increasingly viewed as a major factor in the ecology of marine communities and its impact appears to be increasing with environmental change, such as global warming. The temperate macroalga Delisea pulchra bleaches in Southeast Australia during warm summer periods, a phenomenon which previous studies have indicated is caused by a temperature induced bacterial disease. In order to better understand the ecology of this disease, the bacterial communities associated with threes type of samples was investigated using 16S rRNA gene and environmental shotgun sequencing: 1) unbleached (healthy) D. pulchra 2) bleached parts of D. pulchra and 3) apparently healthy tissue adjacent to bleached regions. Phylogenetic differences between healthy and bleached communities mainly reflected relative changes in the taxa Colwelliaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Thalassomonas and Parvularcula. Comparative metagenomics showed clear difference in the communities of healthy and diseased D. pulchra as reflected by changes in functions associated with transcriptional regulation, cation/multidrug efflux and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. Importantly, the phylogenetic and functional composition of apparently healthy tissue adjacent to bleached sections of the thalli indicated that changes in the microbial communities already occur in the absence of visible tissue damage. This shift in unbleached sections might be due to the decrease in furanones, algal metabolites which are antagonists of bacterial quorum sensing. This study reveals the complex shift in the community composition associated with bleaching of Delisea pulchra and together with previous studies is consistent with a model in which elevated temperatures reduce levels of chemical defenses in stressed thalli, leading to colonization or proliferation by opportunistic pathogens or scavengers.

AB  - Due to the increasing limitations and negative impacts of the current options for preventing and managing diseases, including chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, alternative therapies are needed, especially ones utilizing and maximizing natural products (NPs). NPs abound with diverse bioactive primary and secondary metabolites and compounds with therapeutic properties. Marine probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that inhabit marine environments and can benefit their hosts by improving health, growth, and disease resistance. Several studies have shown they possess potential bioactive and therapeutic actions against diverse disease conditions, thus opening the way for possible exploitation of their benefits through their application. Pseudoalteromonas spp. are a widely distributed heterotrophic, flagellated, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped, and gram-negative marine probiotic bacteria species with reported therapeutic capabilities, including anti-cancer and -bacterial effects. This review discusses the basic concepts of marine probiotics and their therapeutic effects. Additionally, a survey of the anticancer and antibacterial effects of Pseudoalteromonas spp. is presented. Finally, marine probiotic production, advances, prospects, and future perspectives is presented.

AB  - Marine macrophytes (seagrasses and macroalgae) and their epiphytic microorganisms play an important role in the ecological and biochemical processes of coastal oceans. However, simultaneous comparative studies on the biodiversity and functions of epiphytic bacteria and fungi associated with marine macrophytes have not been conducted. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to describe the epiphytic bacterial and fungal communities of 11 common macroalgae and 2 seagrasses from an intertidal zone of northern China and compare them with seawater communities. The results showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota were the dominant bacterial phyla in marine macrophytes, whereas Ascomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla. The alpha diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities in seagrasses was the highest of all macrophyte samples. This may have been related to their ability to recruit microorganisms from multiple sources. Host phylogeny may influence bacterial community structure, and geographical differences may influence fungal community structure. The FAPROTAX data indicated that C metabolic microbes were enriched in marine macrophytes, while the FUNGuild data indicated that undefined saprotroph, which participated in organic matter degradation, were also enriched in marine macrophytes. These findings provide a theoretical basis regarding the epiphytic microorganisms of macrophytes and may offer new insights to support the improved ecological restoration of seagrass and macroalgae beds.

AB  - Insights into the diversity of marine natural microbial biofilms, as for example those developing at the surface of marine macroalgae, can be obtained by using molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA genes. We applied denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with 16S rRNA genes–specific primers for Planctomycetes to compare the communities of these organisms developing on six different macroalgae (Chondrus crispus, Fucus spiralis, Mastocarpus stellatus, Porphyra dioica, Sargassum muticum, and Ulva sp.) sampled in spring 2012 in two rocky beaches in the north of Portugal. Planctomycetes can be one of the dominant organisms found in the epibacterial community of macroalgae, and we wanted to determine the degree of specificity and the spatial variation of these group. Shannon diversity indexes obtained from the comparison of DGGE profiles were similar in all the macroalgae, and in both sites, F. spiralis was the algae presenting lower Planctomycetes diversity, while M. stellatus and P. dioica from Porto showed the highest diversity. The analysis of DGGE profiles, including anosim statistics, indicate the existence of a specific Planctomycetes community associated with the algal host, likely independent of geographical variation. Sequencing of DGGE bands indicated that Planctomycetes communities were highly diverse, and some Operational Taxonomic Units seemed to be specifically associated with each macroalgae.

AB  - Within Europe over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in seaweeds cultivated for human consumption. For food safety reasons, it is important to assess the microbiological and nutritional quality of the biomass. The fresh and dried edible seaweeds Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima were assessed over two consecutive years for the presence of microorganisms. Seaweed samples supplied from Scotland were stored under isothermal conditions for specific time intervals depending on the sample’s condition (fresh, dried or rehydrated). During storage, microbiological analyses were performed for the enumeration of Total Viable Counts (TVC), Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp., as well as yeasts and molds. Additionally, bacterial colonies from the Marine Agar growth medium were isolated and subjected to PCR-RAPD analysis for characterization of the bacterial diversity of seaweeds. Bacterial isolates with different fingerprint patterns were further subjected to sequencing (16S rDNA, V1–V4 region). The presence of human pathogenic bacteria was also investigated. Results showed that the initial population of TVC was differentiated depending on the year of seaweed harvest, being closer to the enumeration limit (1.0 log CFU/g) in fresh samples from 2020 and higher in samples from 2019 (6.7 and 3.9 log CFU/g in A. esculenta and S. latissima, respectively). DNA-based analysis revealed the presence of Psychrobacter, Cobetia and Pseudomonas species in A. esculenta, while Psychrobacter and Micrococcus species were present in S. latissima.

AB  - Seaweeds are highly perishable foods due to their richness in nutrients. High pressure processing (HPP) has been applied for extending the shelf life of fresh seaweeds but there is no information on the effect of HPP on the bacterial diversity of seaweeds. The culturable bacteria of six species of fresh edible seaweeds (green seaweeds Codium fragile and Ulva lactuca, brown seaweeds Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria ochroleuca and Undaria pinnatifida, and red seaweed Chondrus crispus) were investigated and compared to those of HPP-treated (400 and 600 MPa for 5 min) seaweeds, at the start and end of their refrigerated storage period. A total of 523 and 506 bacterial isolates were respectively retrieved from untreated and HPP-treated seaweeds. Isolates from untreated seaweeds belonged to 18 orders, 35 families, 71 genera and 135 species whereas isolates from HPP-treated seaweeds belonged to 13 orders, 23 families, 43 genera and 103 species. HPP treatment significantly reduced the number of isolates belonging to 6 families and greatly increased the number of Bacillaceae isolates. At the end of storage, decreases in bacterial diversity at the genus and species level were observed for untreated as well as for HPP-treated seaweeds.

AB  - Macroalgae play a crucial role in marine ecosystems when they contribute to the global primary production in the habitats formation, providing food and shelter to a range of aquatic organisms. They have a number of interactions with bacteria and other organisms such as fouling and disease. To inhibit the settling, growing, and biofilm formation by bacteria, it has been suggested that the macroalgae influence bacterial metabolism and quorum sensing through the production of secondary metabolites with antibiotic effect. Macroalgae-bacteria interactions have been investigated for many years. These interactions can be beneficial when the bacteria assist with the normal development of macroalgae as well as reducing secondary fouling on the algal surface. On the other hand, the interactions may have a deleterious effect when the biofilm impairs the photosynthetic ability or promotes disease development. This review reports the recent advances in the understanding of bacteria-brown algae interactions, highlighting the diversity and functional role of epiphytic bacteria, including the maintenance of the health of the algae and the biological activities described from this association. Through combined bacterial culture, microscopy, and molecular biology, it has been possible to identify and establish the phylogenetic origin of different bacterial communities associated with brown algae, being predominantly the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Further investigation of the bacterial communities that live on different macroalgae using new technologies are still required, mainly to evaluate the production and secretions of metabolites with biotechnological potential.

AB  - Coastal marine macrophytes exhibit some of the highest rates of primary productivity in the world. They have been found to host a diverse set of microbes, many of which may impact the biology of their hosts through metabolisms that are unique to microbial taxa. Here, we characterized the metabolic functions of macrophyte-associated microbial communities using metagenomes collected from 2 species of kelp (Laminaria setchellii and Nereocystis luetkeana) and 3 marine angiosperms (Phyllospadix scouleri, P. serrulatus, and Zostera marina), including the rhizomes of two surfgrass species (Phyllospadix spp.), the seagrass Zostera marina, and the sediments surrounding P. scouleri and Z. marina. Using metagenomic sequencing, we describe 63 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that potentially benefit from being associated with macrophytes and may contribute to macrophyte fitness through their metabolic activity. Host-associated metagenomes contained genes for the use of dissolved organic matter from hosts and vitamin (B1, B2, B7, B12) biosynthesis in addition to a range of nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms that recycle dissolved inorganic nutrients into forms more available to the host. The rhizosphere of surfgrass and seagrass contained genes for anaerobic microbial metabolisms, including nifH genes associated with nitrogen fixation, despite residing in a well-mixed and oxygenated environment. The range of oxygen environments engineered by macrophytes likely explains the diversity of both oxidizing and reducing microbial metabolisms and contributes to the functional capabilities of microbes and their influences on carbon and nitrogen cycling in nearshore ecosystems.
IMPORTANCE Kelps, seagrasses, and surfgrasses are ecosystem engineers on rocky shorelines, where they show remarkably high levels of primary production. Through analysis of their associated microbial communities, we found a variety of microbial metabolisms that may benefit the host, including nitrogen metabolisms, sulfur oxidation, and the production of B vitamins. In turn, these microbes have the genetic capabilities to assimilate the dissolved organic compounds released by their macrophyte hosts. We describe a range of oxygen environments associated with surfgrass, including low-oxygen microhabitats in their rhizomes that host genes for nitrogen fixation. The tremendous productivity of coastal seaweeds and seagrasses is likely due in part to the activities of associated microbes, and an increased understanding of these associations is needed.

AB  - Kelp forests worldwide are known as hotspots for macroscopic biodiversity and primary production, yet very little is known about the biodiversity and roles of microorganisms in these ecosystems. Secondary production by heterotrophic bacteria associated to kelp is important in the food web as a link between kelp primary production and kelp forest consumers. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between bacterial diversity and two important processes in this ecosystem; bacterial secondary production and primary succession on kelp surfaces. To address this, kelp, Laminaria hyperborea, from southwestern Norway was sampled at different geographical locations and during an annual cycle. Pyrosequencing (454-sequencing) of amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria was used to study bacterial diversity. Incorporation of tritiated thymidine was used as a measure of bacterial production. Our data show that bacterial diversity (richness and evenness) increases with the age of the kelp surface, which corresponds to the primary succession of its bacterial communities. Higher evenness of bacterial operational taxonomical units (OTUs) is linked to higher bacterial production. Owing to the dominance of a few abundant OTUs, kelp surface biofilm communities may be characterized as low-diversity habitats. This is the first detailed study of kelp-associated bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing and it extends current knowledge on microbial community assembly and dynamics on living surfaces.
