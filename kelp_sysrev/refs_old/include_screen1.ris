AB  - Sugar kelp cultivation at the southern end of its range on the east coast of North America is being pursued commercially for human consumption, which demands a high-quality product. Blade quality can be compromised by attached organisms – epibionts. Biweekly examination of epibionts on sugar kelp was conducted April–May 2018, on a kelp farm in eastern Long Island Sound, CT, USA. Culturable Vibrio spp. were not present on kelp blades until May and were limited to only old sections. No Vibrio colonies were human pathogens V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus, based upon ToxR-specific multiplex PCR assays. Neither epibenthic cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. nor the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, microbes of concern because of toxigenicity, were detected on kelp by microscopy or metabarcoding of partial rRNA genes. The lacy bryozoan was the only epibiotic animal observed that could cause damage to kelp, but its abundance was low. Summarizing most-common sequence reads, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial group on kelp blades (49%) and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant in seawater (39%). Bacillariophyta were the most abundant eukaryotes on kelp blades (36%) and Dinoflagellata were the most abundant eukaryotes in seawater (43%). Molecular operational taxonomic unit matrices were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling; the most prominent structure for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities was the separation between blade and seawater samples. This spatial separation explained 81% and 76% of the variation among prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, respectively. Indicator Species Analysis identified Gammaproteobacteria (55%) and Bacillariophyta (56%) to be the most important blade indicator prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. A closer examination of indicator species temporal patterns and their ecophysiology suggested that Aquimarina, Parcubacteria, and Peronosporomycetes are potential pathogens to sugar kelp. Ciliates may be the most important grazers that keep epiphytes (Bacillariophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta) and Peronosporomycetes on kelp in check.

TI  - Microbial “gardening” by a seaweed holobiont: Surface metabolites attract protective and deter pathogenic epibacterial settlement

T2  - Journal of Ecology
AB  - Epimicrobial communities on seaweed surfaces usually contain not only potentially pathogenic but also potentially beneficial micro-organisms. Capacity of terrestrial plants for chemically mediated recruitment, that is, “gardening” of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere was recently demonstrated. Empirical evidence directly linking such chemical “gardening” with the beneficial role of gardened microbes in terrestrial plants is rare and largely missing for aquatic macrophytes. Here, we demonstrate that our model invasive seaweed holobiont Agarophyton vermiculophyllum possesses beneficial microbiota on its surface that provide protection from bacterial pathogens. Metabolites from the algal holobiont’s surface reduced settlement of opportunistic pathogens but attracted protective epibacterial settlement. We tested 58 different bacterial species (isolated from the surface of A. vermiculophyllum) individually in tip bleaching assays. Kordia algicida was identified as a “significant pathogen” inducing a bleaching disease. In addition, nine other species significantly reduced the risk of algal bleaching and were thus “significantly protective”. Additionally, two “potential pathogens” and 10 “potential protectors” were identified. When 19 significant and potential protectors and 3 significant and potential pathogens were tested together, the protective strains fully prevented bleaching, suggesting that a component of A. vermiculophyllum’s epimicrobiome provides an associational defence against pathogens. Chemically mediated selective recruitment of microbes was demonstrated in bioassays, where A. vermiculophyllum surface metabolites attracted the settlement of protective strains, but reduced settlement of pathogens. Synthesis. The capacity of an aquatic macrophyte to chemically “garden” protective micro-organisms to the benefit of strengthened disease resistance is demonstrated for the first time. Such a role of surface chemistry in “gardening” of microbes as found in the current study could also be applicable to other host plant—microbe interactions. Our results may open new avenues towards manipulation of the surface microbiome of seaweeds via chemical “gardening,” enhancing sustainable production of healthy seaweeds.

AB  - Kelp forest ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots, providing habitat for dense assemblages of marine organisms and nutrients for marine and terrestrial food webs. The surfaces of kelps support diverse microbial communities that facilitate the transfer of carbon from algal primary production to higher trophic levels. We quantified the diversity of bacteria on the surfaces of eight sympatric kelp species from four sites in British Columbia. Kelp-associated bacterial communities are significantly different from their environment, even though 86% of their bacterial taxa are shared with seawater and 97% are shared with rocky substrate. This differentiation is driven by differences in relative abundance of the bacterial taxa present. Similarly, a large portion of bacterial taxa (37%) is shared among all eight kelp species, yet differential abundance of bacterial taxa underlies differences in community structure among species. Kelp-associated bacterial diversity does not track host phylogeny; instead bacterial community composition is correlated with the life-history strategy of the host, with annual and perennial kelps supporting divergent bacterial communities. These data provide the first community-scale investigation of kelp forest-associated bacterial diversity. More broadly, this study provides insight into mechanisms that may structure bacterial communities among closely related sympatric host species.

AB  - Our understanding of diseases has been transformed by the realisation that people are holobionts, comprised of a host and its associated microbiome(s). Disease can also have devastating effects on populations of marine organisms, including dominant habitat formers such as seaweed holobionts. However, we know very little about how interactions between microorganisms within microbiomes - of humans or marine organisms – affect host health and there is no underpinning theoretical framework for exploring this. We applied ecological models of succession to bacterial communities to understand how interactions within a seaweed microbiome affect the host. We observed succession of surface microbiomes on the red seaweed Delisea pulchra in situ, following a disturbance, with communities ‘recovering’ to resemble undisturbed states after only 12 days. Further, if this recovery was perturbed, a bleaching disease previously described for this seaweed developed. Early successional strains of bacteria protected the host from colonisation by a pathogenic, later successional strain. Host chemical defences also prevented disease, such that within-microbiome interactions were most important when the host’s chemical defences were inhibited. This is the first experimental evidence that interactions within microbiomes have important implications for host health and disease in a dominant marine habitat-forming organism.

AB  - Elucidating the spatial structure of host-associated microbial communities is essential for understanding taxon-taxon interactions within the microbiota and between microbiota and host. Macroalgae are colonized by complex microbial communities, suggesting intimate symbioses that likely play key roles in both macroalgal and bacterial biology, yet little is known about the spatial organization of microbes associated with macroalgae. Canopy-forming kelp are ecologically significant, fixing teragrams of carbon per year in coastal kelp forest ecosystems. We characterized the micron-scale spatial organization of bacterial communities on blades of the kelp Nereocystis luetkeana using fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging with a probe set combining phylum-, class-, and genus-level probes to localize and identify > 90% of the microbial community.

AB  - Interactions between hosts and their microbiota are vital to the functioning and resilience of macro-organisms. Critically, for hosts that play foundational roles in communities, understanding what drives host–microbiota interactions is essential for informing ecosystem restoration and conservation. We investigated the relative influence of host traits and the surrounding environment on microbial communities associated with the foundational seaweed Phyllospora comosa. We quantified 16 morphological and functional phenotypic traits, including host genetics (using 354 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and surface-associated microbial communities (using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) from 160 individuals sampled from eight sites spanning Phyllospora's entire latitudinal distribution (1,300 km). Combined, these factors explained 54% of the overall variation in Phyllospora's associated microbial community structure, much of which was related to the local environment ( 32%). We found that putative “core” microbial taxa (i.e., present on all Phyllospora individuals sampled) exhibited slightly higher associations with host traits when compared to “variable” taxa (not present on all individuals). We identified several key genetic loci and phenotypic traits in Phyllospora that were strongly related to multiple microbial amplicon sequence variants, including taxa with known associations to seaweed defence, disease and tissue degradation. This information on how host-associated microbial communities vary with host traits and the environment enhances our current understanding of how “holobionts” (hosts plus their microbiota) are structured. Such understanding can be used to inform management strategies of these important and vulnerable habitats.

AB  - Kelp are important primary producers that are colonized by diverse microbes that can have both positive and negative effects on their hosts. The kelp microbiome could support the burgeoning kelp cultivation sector by improving host growth, stress tolerance, and resistance to disease. Fundamental questions about the cultivated kelp microbiome still need to be addressed before microbiome-based approaches can be developed. A critical knowledge gap is how cultivated kelp microbiomes change as hosts grow, particularly following outplanting to sites that vary in abiotic conditions and microbial source pools. In this study we assessed if microbes that colonize kelp in the nursery stage persist after outplanting. We characterized microbiome succession over time on two species of kelp, Alaria marginata and Saccharina latissima, outplanted to open ocean cultivation sites in multiple geographic locations. We tested for host-species specificity of the microbiome and the effect of different abiotic conditions and microbial source pools on kelp microbiome stability during the cultivation process. We found the microbiome of kelp in the nursery is distinct from that of outplanted kelp. Few bacteria persisted on kelp following outplanting. Instead, we identified significant microbiome differences correlated with host species and microbial source pools at each cultivation site. Microbiome variation related to sampling month also indicates that seasonality in host and/or abiotic factors may influence temporal succession and microbiome turnover in cultivated kelps. This study provides a baseline understanding of microbiome dynamics during kelp cultivation and highlights research needs for applying microbiome manipulation to kelp cultivation.

AB  - The microbiome of macroalgae facilitates their adaptation to environmental stress. As bacteria release algal growth and morphogenesis promoting factors (AGMPFs), which are necessary for the healthy development of macroalgae, bacteria play a crucial role in stress adaptation of bacterial-algal interactions. To better understand the level of macroalgal dependence on the microbiome under various stress factors such as light, temperature, salt, or micropollutants, we propose a reductionist analysis of a tripartite model system consisting of the axenic green alga Ulva (Chlorophyta) re-infected with two essential bacteria. This analysis will allow us to decipher the stress response of each symbiont within this cross-kingdom interaction. The paper highlights studies on possible survival strategies embedded in cross-kingdom interactions that govern the stress adaptation, including general features of metabolic pathways in the macroalgal host or more specific features such as alterations in the composition and/or diversity of bacterial assemblages within the microbiome community. Additionally, we present some preliminary results regarding the effect of recently isolated bacteria from the Potter Cove, King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo) in Antarctica, on the model system Ulva mutabilis Føyn purified gametes. The results indicate that cold-adapted bacteria release AGMPFs, inducing cell differentiation, and cell division in purified cultures. We propose that microbiome engineering can be used to increase the adaptability of macroalgae to stressful situations with implications for, e.g., the sustainable management of (land-based) aquaculture systems.

AB  - Like most eukaryotes, brown algae live in association with bacterial communities that frequently have beneficial effects on their development. Ectocarpus is a genus of small filamentous brown algae, which comprises a strain that has recently colonized freshwater, a rare transition in this lineage. We generated an inventory of bacteria in Ectocarpus cultures and examined the effect they have on acclimation to an environmental change, that is, the transition from seawater to freshwater medium. Our results demonstrate that Ectocarpus depends on bacteria for this transition: cultures that have been deprived of their associated microbiome do not survive a transfer to freshwater, but restoring their microflora also restores the capacity to acclimate to this change. Furthermore, the transition between the two culture media strongly affects the bacterial community composition. Examining a range of other closely related algal strains, we observed that the presence of two bacterial operational taxonomic units correlated significantly with an increase in low salinity tolerance of the algal culture. Despite differences in the community composition, no indications were found for functional differences in the bacterial metagenomes predicted to be associated with algae in the salinities tested, suggesting functional redundancy in the associated bacterial community. Our study provides an example of how microbial communities may impact the acclimation and physiological response of algae to different environments, and thus possibly act as facilitators of speciation. It paves the way for functional examinations of the underlying host–microbe interactions, both in controlled laboratory and natural conditions.

AB  - Marine macroalgae are constantly exposed to epibacterial colonizers. The epiphytic bacterial patterns and their temporal and spatial variability on host algae are poorly understood. To investigate the interaction between marine macroalgae and epiphytic bacteria, this study tested if the composition of epibacterial communities on different macroalgae was specific and persisted under varying biotic and abiotic environmental conditions over a 2-year observation time frame. Epibacterial communities on the co-occurring macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Ulva intestinalis were repeatedly sampled in summer and winter of 2007 and 2008. The epibacterial community composition was analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene libraries. Epibacterial community profiles did not only differ significantly at each sampling interval among algal species, but also showed consistent seasonal differences on each algal species at a bacterial phylum level. These compositional patterns re-occurred at the same season of two consecutive years. Within replicates of the same algal species, the composition of bacterial phyla was subject to shifts at the bacterial species level, both within the same season but at different years and between different seasons. However, 7–16% of sequences were identified as species specific to the host alga. These findings demonstrate that marine macroalgae harbour species-specific and temporally adapted epiphytic bacterial biofilms on their surfaces. Since several algal host-specific bacteria were highly similar to other bacteria known to either avoid subsequent colonization by eukaryotic larvae or to exhibit potent antibacterial activities, algal host-specific bacterial associations are expected to play an important role for marine macroalgae.

AU  - Chen, Melissa Y.

T2  - Molecular Ecology
AB  - Macroalgae variably promote and deter microbial growth through release of organic carbon and antimicrobial compounds into the water column. Consequently, macroalgae influence the microbial composition of the surrounding water column and biofilms on nearby surfaces. Here, we use manipulative experiments to test the hypotheses that (i) Nereocystis luetkeana and Mastocarpus sp. macroalgae alter the water column microbiota in species-specific manner, that (ii) neighbouring macroalgae alter the bacterial communities on the surface (epibiota) of actively growing Nereocystis luetkeana meristem fragments (NMFs), and that (iii) neighbours alter NMF growth rate. We also assess the impact of laboratory incubation on macroalgal epibiota by comparing each species to wild counterparts. We find strong differences between the Nereocystis and Mastocarpus epibiota that are maintained in the laboratory. Nereocystis and Mastocarpus alter water column bacterial community composition and richness in a species specific manner, but cause only small compositional shifts on NMF surfaces that do not differ by species, and do not change richness. Co-incubation with macroalgae results in significant change in abundance of fivefold more genera in the water column compared to NMF surfaces, although the direction (i.e., enrichment or reduction) of shift is generally consistent between the water and NMF surfaces. Finally, NMFs grew during the experiment, but growth did not depend on the presence or identity of neighbouring macroalgae. Thus, macroalgae exhibit a strong and species-specific influence on the water column microbiota, but a much weaker influence on the epibiota of neighbouring macroalgae. Overall, these results support the idea that macroalgae surfaces are highly selective and demonstrate that modulations of macroalgal microbiota operate within an overarching paradigm of host species specificity.

AB  - Brown algae are key components of marine ecosystems and live in association with bacteria that are essential for their growth and development. Ectocarpus siliculosus is a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. Here we use this model to start disentangling the complex interactions that may occur between the algal host and its associated bacteria. We report the genome-sequencing of 10 alga-associated bacteria and the genome-based reconstruction of their metabolic networks. The predicted metabolic capacities were then used to identify metabolic complementarities between the algal host and the bacteria, highlighting a range of potentially beneficial metabolite exchanges between them. These putative exchanges allowed us to predict consortia consisting of a subset of these ten bacteria that would best complement the algal metabolism. Finally, co-culture experiments were set up with a subset of these consortia to monitor algal growth as well as the presence of key algal metabolites. Although we did not fully control but only modified bacterial communities in our experiments, our data demonstrated a significant increase in algal growth in cultures inoculated with the selected consortia. In several cases, we also detected, in algal extracts, the presence of key metabolites predicted to become producible via an exchange of metabolites between the alga and the microbiome. Thus, although further methodological developments will be necessary to better control and understand microbial interactions in Ectocarpus, our data suggest that metabolic complementarity is a good indicator of beneficial metabolite exchanges in the holobiont.

AB  - Characterizing patterns in the microbial communities associated with canopy-forming kelps is critical to understanding the mechanisms shaping macroalgal microbiomes. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized bacterial and archaeal communities associated with giant kelp in the Santa Barbara Channel. Our results indicate that kelp-associated microbial communities are altered in the presence of epiphytic bryozoans and reflect changes previously observed in other studies of stressed macroalgae. This observation is indicative of patterns of microbiome disruption (dysbiosis) and opportunistic pathogenesis that may have implications for the health and productivity of foundational species of macroalgae. Our study highlights new patterns in host–microbiome associations and reveals the importance of considering host source and condition when investigating the dynamics of macroalgal microbiomes.

AB  - Macroalgal holobiont studies involve understanding interactions between the host, its microbiota, and the environment. We analyzed the effect of bacteria–kelp interactions on phenotypic responses of two genetically distinct populations of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (north and south), exposed to different nitrogen (N) concentrations. In co-culture experiments with different N concentration treatments, we evaluated kelp growth responses and changes in three specific molecular markers associated with the N cycle, both in epiphytic bacteria (relative abundance of nrfA-gene: cytochrome c nitrite reductase) and macroalgae (expression of NR-gene: nitrate reductase; GluSyn-gene: glutamate synthase). Both kelp populations responded differently to N limitation, with M. pyrifera-south sporophytes having a lower specific growth rate (SGR) under N-limiting conditions than the northern population; M. pyrifera-north sporophytes showed no significant differences in SGR when exposed to low-N and high-N concentrations. This corresponded to a higher GluSyn-gene expression in the M. pyrifera-north sporophytes and the co-occurrence of specific nrfA bacterial taxa. These bacteria may increase ammonium availability under low-N concentrations, allowing M. pyrifera-north to optimize nutrient assimilation by increasing the expression of GluSyn. We conclude that bacteria–kelp interactions are important in enhancing kelp growth rates under low N availability, although this effect may be regulated by the genetic background of kelp populations.

AB  - Most current approaches to analyse metagenomic data rely on reference genomes. Novel microbial communities extend far beyond the coverage of reference databases and de novo metagenome assembly from complex microbial communities remains a great challenge. Here we present a novel experimental and bioinformatic framework, metaSort, for effective construction of bacterial genomes from metagenomic samples. MetaSort provides a sorted mini-metagenome approach based on flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing methodologies, and employs new computational algorithms to efficiently recover high-quality genomes from the sorted mini-metagenome by the complementary of the original metagenome. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrated that metaSort has an excellent and unbiased performance on genome recovery and assembly. Furthermore, we applied metaSort to an unexplored microflora colonized on the surface of marine kelp and successfully recovered 75 high-quality genomes at one time. This approach will greatly improve access to microbial genomes from complex or novel communities.

AB  - Macroalgal surface constitutes a peculiar ecological niche and an advantageous substratum for microorganisms able to degrade the wide diversity of algal glycans. The degrading enzymatic activities of macroalgal epiphytes are of paramount interest for the industrial by-product sector and biomass resource applications. We characterized the polysaccharide hydrolytic profile of bacterial isolates obtained from three macroalgal species: the red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis and Sphaerococcus coronopifolius (Rhodophyceae) and the brown Halopteris scoparia (Phaeophyceae), sampled in South Portugal. Bacterial enrichment cultures supplemented with chlorinated aliphatic compounds, typically released by marine algae, were established using as inoculum the decaying biomass of the three macroalgae, obtaining a collection of 634 bacterial strains. Although collected from the same site and exposed to the same seawater seeding microbiota, macroalgal cultivable bacterial communities in terms of functional and phylogenetic diversity showed host specificity. Isolates were tested for the hydrolysis of starch, pectin, alginate and agar, exhibiting a different hydrolytic potential according to their host: A. taxiformis showed the highest percentage of active isolates (91%), followed by S. coronopifolius (54%) and H. scoparia (46%). Only 30% of the isolates were able to degrade starch, while the other polymers were degraded by 55–58% of the isolates. Interestingly, several isolates showed promiscuous capacities to hydrolyze more than one polysaccharide. The isolate functional fingerprint was statistically correlated to bacterial phylogeny, host species and enrichment medium. In conclusion, this work depicts macroalgae as holobionts with an associated microbiota of interest for blue biotechnologies, suggesting isolation strategies and bacterial targets for polysaccharidases’ discovery.

AB  - Macroalgae and their rocky substrates both support diverse and abundant microbiota, performing essential ecological functions in marine ecosystem. However, the differences in the epiphytic microbial communities on macroalgae and rocky substrate are still poorly understood. In this study, the epiphytic microbial communities on four macroalgae (Corallina officinalis, Rhodomela confervoides, Sargassum thunbergii, and Ulva linza) and their rocky substrates from Weihai coast zone were characterized using high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the alpha diversity indices were greater in rocky substrates than that in macroalgae. The microbial similarities among macroalgae and rocky substrate groups tended to decrease from the high taxonomic ranks to lower ranks, only 22.69% of the total amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were shared between them. The functional analysis revealed that the microbiotas were mainly involved in metabolic activities. This study would provide the theoretical foundation for macroalgal cultivation and algal reef applications.

AB  - Microbes are vitally important for seaweed growth, functioning and reproduction, and are likely to have a big impact on aquaculture. Algae-associated bacteria, however, remain mostly unmonitored in aquaculture. Here, we studied the microbiomes of Ulva australis and Ulva lacinulata, three natural populations and an aquaculture set-up, based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. The microbiome of cultivated Ulva was pronouncedly different from natural populations, and was specifically associated with higher relative abundances of known growth-promoting bacteria Sulfitobacter and Roseobacter. On a smaller scale, there were species-specific differences as well. In general, Ulva-associated communities were highly distinct from environmental seawater and sediment reference samples. We demonstrated a workflow generating full-length 16S rRNA sequences in real-time using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We compared 3 different reference databases to assign taxonomy with Kraken2 (SILVA, Greengenes and NCBI). In addition, we used Nanopore's cloud-based EPI2ME workflow for comparison. All four methods yielded comparable results in terms of relative abundances on phylum and order level, but differed widely in alpha diversity indices at genus level. Using the NCBI 16S database, especially in combination with the EPI2ME workflow, resulted in a high proportion of false identifications of cyanobacteria due to chloroplast contamination. Based on our results, we recommend assigning taxonomy of Nanopore-derived long-reads with Kraken2 and the SILVA database in seaweed-microbiome studies. The protocols used in this study provide results within 24 h and may be applicable for rapid microbial surveys in aquaculture.

AB  - Macroalgae surfaces are considered as potentially suitable substrata present underwater for the dynamic epibiotic microbiome. They secrete various organic substances as nutrients for the multiplication of bacteria and the formation of microbial biofilms. The microbial biofilm itself acts as a biological defence mechanism to prevent the establishment of pathogenic microbes as well as to protect the surface of the seaweed from the macrofoulers. In most cases, the presence and diversity of these organisms are host-specific. The macroalgal host and their associated microbiont are often referred to as a ‘Holobiont’. The surface-associated microbiome of macroalgae plays a crucial role in the growth, morphogenesis and defence in the normal favourable environmental conditions of the macroalgae (Symbiotism). Whereas, when there is a change i.e. reversed, unfavourable conditions, the microbiome reverses its symbiotic nature and affects growth and degrades the macroalgae by causing different diseases in different species. In parallel, marine macroalgae employ different defence mechanisms, a physical defence such as continuous shedding of the outer layer of cells, and the mucilaginous covering and chemical defence such as the production of secondary metabolites. The following chapter focuses on the macroalgal surface-associated microbiome and its defence system with a certain number of relevant examples from related literature on this subject.

T2  - Science of The Total Environment
AB  - While microbiome alterations are increasingly proposed as a rapid mechanism to buffer organisms under changing environmental conditions, studies of these processes in the marine realm are lagging far behind their terrestrial counterparts. Here, we used a controlled laboratory experiment to examine whether the thermal tolerance of the brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma, a common species in European coastal ecosystems, could be enhanced by the repeated addition of bacteria from its natural environment. Juvenile algae from three genotypes were subjected for two weeks to a temperature gradient, spanning almost the entire thermal range that can be tolerated by the species (11–30 °C). At the start of the experiment and again in the middle of the experiment, the algae were inoculated with bacteria from their natural environment or left untouched as a control. Relative growth rate was measured over the two-week period, and we assessed bacterial community composition prior to and at the end of the experiment. Since the growth of D. dichotoma over the full thermal gradient was not affected by supplementing bacteria, our results indicate no scope for bacterial-mediated stress alleviation. The minimal changes in the bacterial communities linked to bacterial addition, particularly at temperatures above the thermal optimum (22–23 °C), suggest the existence of a barrier to bacterial recruitment. These findings indicate that ecological bacterial rescue is unlikely to play a role in mitigating the effects of ocean warming on this brown seaweed.

T2  - Annual Review of Marine Science
AB  - The holobiont concept (i.e., multiple living beings in close symbiosis with one another and functioning as a unit) is revolutionizing our understanding of biology, especially in marine systems. The earliest marine holobiont was likely a syntrophic partnership of at least two prokaryotic members. Since then, symbiosis has enabled marine organisms to conquer all ocean habitats through the formation of holobionts with a wide spectrum of complexities. However, most scientific inquiries have focused on isolated organisms and their adaptations to specific environments. In this review, we attempt to illustrate why a holobiont perspective—specifically, the study of how numerous organisms form a discrete ecological unit through symbiosis—will be a more impactful strategy to advance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine life. We argue that this approach is instrumental in addressing the threats to marine biodiversity posed by the current global environmental crisis.

T2  - Symbiosis
AB  - Aquaculture is an important food producing sector to fulfill nutritional food demand of a continuously growing population. However, disease outbreak has become a major problem in aquaculture which cause huge economic loss to aquaculture industries. The use of expensive chemotherapeutic drugs for treatment have negative impacts on the aquatic environment. So there is a growing concern to find other safe, non-antibiotic based and eco-friendly alternative for the treatment of the diseases. The use of probiotics is a promising alternative approach for the control of infectious agents and treatment of diseases. The benefits of probiotic include stimulation of growth, improved digestion, enhanced immune response and recuperate the water quality as well. Probiotics concoct the fish to fight against various pathogens and improves the overall health as they show anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties. The use of probiotics in aquaculture is a recent trend and its efficacy in aquatic environment has not been studied extensively. This review paper provides the current knowledge of the use of probiotics in aquaculture, selection criteria, types of probiotics used in aquaculture, their mode of action and administrative methods of probiotics in aquaculture.

AB  - Different marine seaweed species have been shown to harbour specific bacterial communities, however, the extent to which vertical symbiont transmission from parents to offspring contributes to host-specificity is unclear. Here we use fluorescence and electron microscopy as well as 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis to investigate symbiont transmission in members of the three major seaweed groups (green Chlorophyta, red Rhodophyta and brown Phaeophyceae). We found seaweeds employ diverse strategies to transfer symbionts to their progeny. For instance, the green Ulva australis does not appear to have the capacity for vertical transmission. In contrast, the brown Phyllospora comosa adopts a non-selective vertical transmission. The red Delisea pulchra demonstrates weak selectivity in symbiont transmission, while the brown Hormosira banksii exhibits a strongly selective symbiont transfer. Mucilage on the gametes appears to facilitate vertical transmission and transferred bacteria have predicted properties that could support early development of the seaweeds. Previous meta-analysis has indicated that vertical transmission is rare in aquatic compared to terrestrial environments, however, our results contribute to the growing evidence that this might not be the case and that instead vertical transmission with various degrees of symbiont selection occurs in the ecologically important group of seaweeds.

AB  - Although the effects of certain species of seaweed on the microbial community structure have long been a research focus in marine ecology, the response of the microbial community to seasons and different seaweed species is poorly understood. In the present study, a total of 39 seawater samples were collected during 3 months from three zones: Neoporphyra haitanensis cultivation zones (P), Gracilaria lemaneiformis-Saccharina japonica mixed cultivation zones (G), and control zones (C). These samples were then analyzed using 18S and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to ascertain the fungal and bacterial communities, respectively, along with the determination of environmental factors. Our results showed that increased dissolved oxygen (DO), decreased inorganic nutrients, and released dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seaweed cultivation zone predominantly altered the variability of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial communities. Certain microbial groups such as Aurantivirga, Pseudomonas, and Woeseia were stimulated and enriched in response to seaweed cultivation, and the enriched microorganisms varied across seaweed cultivation zones due to differences in the composition of released DOM. In addition, seasonal changes in salinity and temperature were strongly correlated with microbial community composition and structure. Our study provides new insights into the interactions between seaweed and microbial communities.

AB  - Seaweed associated bacteria can be exploited for sustainable production and conservation of seaweeds, although limited information exists in several coastal waters in West Africa. Here, the diversity and abundance of bacteria on five seaweeds, Sargassum vulgare, Padina durvillaei, Hydropuntia dentata, Hypnea musciformis and Ulva fasciata, and surrounding seawaters across five coastal sites in the Central and Western regions of Ghana were investigated. Biochemical tests and MALDIâ€“TOF identification system were used to determine the bacteria diversity and abundance on the seaweeds and seawater. A total of 530 bacterial isolates, belonging to 28 species (and mostly Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) were identified. A higher diversity of bacteria species was found associated with the seaweeds (83%) than in seawater (17%). Bacterial composition was similar among taxonomically-related seaweeds. The brown (S. vulgare) and red (H. musciformis) seaweeds recorded the most and least diverse bacterial assemblage, respectively. Seasonally, bacterial diversity and abundance were marginally higher in the wet season. The study provides important baseline information on the spatial, temporal and taxonomic distribution of bacteria associated with commercially valuable seaweed species in the coastal areas of Ghana. The results are also important for the sustainable exploitation and conservation of these important macroalgae in Ghana and elsewhere.

AB  - Interrelations between epiphytic bacteria and macroalgae are multifaceted and complicated, though little is known about the community structure, interaction and functions of those epiphytic bacteria. This study comprehensively characterized the epiphytic bacterial communities associated with eight different common seaweeds collected from a rocky intertidal zone on the Indian Ocean at Cape Vidal, South Africa. High-throughput sequencing analyses indicated that seaweed-associated bacterial communities were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed the presence of elemental composition in the surface of examined seaweeds, in varying concentrations. Cluster analysis showed that bacterial communities of brown seaweeds (SW2 and SW4) were closely resembled those of green seaweeds (SW1) and red seaweeds (SW7) while those of brown seaweeds formed a separate branch. Predicted functional capabilities of epiphytic bacteria using PICRUSt analysis revealed abundance of genes related to metabolic and biosynthetic activities. Further important identified functional interactions included genes for bacterial chemotaxis, which could be responsible for the observed association and network of elemental-microbes interaction. The study concludes that the diversity of epiphytic bacteria on seaweed surfaces is greatly influenced by algal organic exudates as well as elemental deposits on their surfaces, which triggers chemotaxis responses from epiphytic bacteria with the requisite genes to metabolise those substrates.

AB  - Disease in the marine environment is predicted to increase with anthropogenic stressors and already affects major habitat-formers, such as corals and seaweeds. Solutions to address this issue are urgently needed. The seaweed Delisea pulchra is prone to a bleaching disease, which is caused by opportunistic pathogens and involves bacterial dysbiosis. Bacteria that can inhibit these pathogens and/or counteract dysbiosis are therefore hypothesised to reduce disease. This study aimed to identify such disease-protective bacteria and investigate their protective action. One strain, Phaeobacter sp. BS52, isolated from healthy D. pulchra, was antagonistic towards bleaching pathogens and significantly increased the proportion of healthy individuals when applied before the pathogen challenge (pathogen-only vs. BS52 + pathogen: 41–80%), and to a level similar to the control. However, no significant negative correlations between the relative abundances of pathogens and BS52 on D. pulchra were detected. Instead, inoculation of BS52 mitigated pathogen-induced changes in the epibacterial community. These observations suggest that the protective activity of BS52 was due to its ability to prevent dysbiosis, rather than direct pathogen inhibition. This study demonstrates the feasibility of manipulating bacterial communities in seaweeds to reduce disease and that mitigation of dysbiosis can have positive health outcomes.

AB  - Despite an increasing awareness of disease impacts on both cultivated and native seaweed populations, the development of marine probiotics has been limited and predominately focused on farmed animals. Bleaching (loss of thallus pigmentation) is one of the most prevalent diseases observed in marine macroalgae. Endemic probiotic bacteria have been characterized to prevent bleaching disease in red macroalgae Agarophyton vermiculophyllum and Delisea pulchra; however, the extent to which probiotic strains provide cross-protection to non-endemic hosts and the influence of native microbiota remain unknown. Using A. vermiculophyllum as a model, we demonstrate that co-inoculation with the pathogen Pseudoalteromonas arctica G-MAN6 and D. pulchra probiotic strain Phaeobacter sp. BS52 or Pseudoalteromonas sp. PB2-1 reduced the disease risks compared to the pathogen only treatment. Moreover, non-endemic probiotics outperformed the endemic probiotic strain Ralstonia sp. G-NY6 in the presence of the host natural microbiota. This study highlights how the native microbiota can impact the effectiveness of marine probiotics and illustrates the potential of harnessing probiotics that can function across different hosts to mitigate the impact of emerging marine diseases.

AB  - Macroalgae are important ecosystem engineers in temperate marine waters. The function of macroalgae is intimately linked to the composition and structure of their epibiotic bacterial, communities, and evidence has emerged that bacteria can also have a negative impact on their host by causing disease. A few examples exist where bacteria have been unambiguously linked to macroalgal disease, however in many cases, pathogenicity has not been clearly separated from saprophytic behaviour or secondary colonization after disease initiation. Nevertheless, pathogenic pressure by bacteria might be substantial, as macroalgae have evolved a range of innate and induced defence mechanism that have the potential to control bacterial attacks. The presence and abundance of virulence factors in marine bacteria, which have not previously been recognized as pathogens, also represents an underappreciated, opportunistic potential for disease. Given that virulence expression in opportunistic pathogens is often dependent on environmental conditions, we predict that current and future anthropogenic changes in the marine environment will lead to an increase in the occurrence of macroalgal disease. This review highlights important areas of research that require future attention to understand the link between environmental change, opportunistic pathogens and macroalgal health in the world's oceans.

AB  - Due to the increasing limitations and negative impacts of the current options for preventing and managing diseases, including chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, alternative therapies are needed, especially ones utilizing and maximizing natural products (NPs). NPs abound with diverse bioactive primary and secondary metabolites and compounds with therapeutic properties. Marine probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that inhabit marine environments and can benefit their hosts by improving health, growth, and disease resistance. Several studies have shown they possess potential bioactive and therapeutic actions against diverse disease conditions, thus opening the way for possible exploitation of their benefits through their application. Pseudoalteromonas spp. are a widely distributed heterotrophic, flagellated, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped, and gram-negative marine probiotic bacteria species with reported therapeutic capabilities, including anti-cancer and -bacterial effects. This review discusses the basic concepts of marine probiotics and their therapeutic effects. Additionally, a survey of the anticancer and antibacterial effects of Pseudoalteromonas spp. is presented. Finally, marine probiotic production, advances, prospects, and future perspectives is presented.

AB  - Marine macrophytes (seagrasses and macroalgae) and their epiphytic microorganisms play an important role in the ecological and biochemical processes of coastal oceans. However, simultaneous comparative studies on the biodiversity and functions of epiphytic bacteria and fungi associated with marine macrophytes have not been conducted. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to describe the epiphytic bacterial and fungal communities of 11 common macroalgae and 2 seagrasses from an intertidal zone of northern China and compare them with seawater communities. The results showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota were the dominant bacterial phyla in marine macrophytes, whereas Ascomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla. The alpha diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities in seagrasses was the highest of all macrophyte samples. This may have been related to their ability to recruit microorganisms from multiple sources. Host phylogeny may influence bacterial community structure, and geographical differences may influence fungal community structure. The FAPROTAX data indicated that C metabolic microbes were enriched in marine macrophytes, while the FUNGuild data indicated that undefined saprotroph, which participated in organic matter degradation, were also enriched in marine macrophytes. These findings provide a theoretical basis regarding the epiphytic microorganisms of macrophytes and may offer new insights to support the improved ecological restoration of seagrass and macroalgae beds.

AB  - Within Europe over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in seaweeds cultivated for human consumption. For food safety reasons, it is important to assess the microbiological and nutritional quality of the biomass. The fresh and dried edible seaweeds Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima were assessed over two consecutive years for the presence of microorganisms. Seaweed samples supplied from Scotland were stored under isothermal conditions for specific time intervals depending on the sample’s condition (fresh, dried or rehydrated). During storage, microbiological analyses were performed for the enumeration of Total Viable Counts (TVC), Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp., as well as yeasts and molds. Additionally, bacterial colonies from the Marine Agar growth medium were isolated and subjected to PCR-RAPD analysis for characterization of the bacterial diversity of seaweeds. Bacterial isolates with different fingerprint patterns were further subjected to sequencing (16S rDNA, V1–V4 region). The presence of human pathogenic bacteria was also investigated. Results showed that the initial population of TVC was differentiated depending on the year of seaweed harvest, being closer to the enumeration limit (1.0 log CFU/g) in fresh samples from 2020 and higher in samples from 2019 (6.7 and 3.9 log CFU/g in A. esculenta and S. latissima, respectively). DNA-based analysis revealed the presence of Psychrobacter, Cobetia and Pseudomonas species in A. esculenta, while Psychrobacter and Micrococcus species were present in S. latissima.

AB  - Coastal marine macrophytes exhibit some of the highest rates of primary productivity in the world. They have been found to host a diverse set of microbes, many of which may impact the biology of their hosts through metabolisms that are unique to microbial taxa. Here, we characterized the metabolic functions of macrophyte-associated microbial communities using metagenomes collected from 2 species of kelp (Laminaria setchellii and Nereocystis luetkeana) and 3 marine angiosperms (Phyllospadix scouleri, P. serrulatus, and Zostera marina), including the rhizomes of two surfgrass species (Phyllospadix spp.), the seagrass Zostera marina, and the sediments surrounding P. scouleri and Z. marina. Using metagenomic sequencing, we describe 63 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that potentially benefit from being associated with macrophytes and may contribute to macrophyte fitness through their metabolic activity. Host-associated metagenomes contained genes for the use of dissolved organic matter from hosts and vitamin (B1, B2, B7, B12) biosynthesis in addition to a range of nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms that recycle dissolved inorganic nutrients into forms more available to the host. The rhizosphere of surfgrass and seagrass contained genes for anaerobic microbial metabolisms, including nifH genes associated with nitrogen fixation, despite residing in a well-mixed and oxygenated environment. The range of oxygen environments engineered by macrophytes likely explains the diversity of both oxidizing and reducing microbial metabolisms and contributes to the functional capabilities of microbes and their influences on carbon and nitrogen cycling in nearshore ecosystems.
IMPORTANCE Kelps, seagrasses, and surfgrasses are ecosystem engineers on rocky shorelines, where they show remarkably high levels of primary production. Through analysis of their associated microbial communities, we found a variety of microbial metabolisms that may benefit the host, including nitrogen metabolisms, sulfur oxidation, and the production of B vitamins. In turn, these microbes have the genetic capabilities to assimilate the dissolved organic compounds released by their macrophyte hosts. We describe a range of oxygen environments associated with surfgrass, including low-oxygen microhabitats in their rhizomes that host genes for nitrogen fixation. The tremendous productivity of coastal seaweeds and seagrasses is likely due in part to the activities of associated microbes, and an increased understanding of these associations is needed.
