Three microbial groups were selected for experimentation; a single-species bacterium; Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, a single-species yeast; Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a multi-species culture; kombucha SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast). Results showed SCOBY cultures were more successful in fermenting A. esculenta than S. latissima due to the lowered glucose content (4.069 ± 0.174 mg / mL and 12.224 ± 2.249 mg / mL, respectively). Likewise, L. plantarum played a major role in fermenting S. latissima, over A. esculenta, resulting in a lowered pH in the former but not the latter (6.44 ± 0.040 and 4.825 ± 0.045, respectively). S. cerevisiae does not appear to have been suitable as a fermentation medium for these two seaweed species under these conditions due to the lack of pH lowering, glucose reduction and acid production. All treatments showed an increased production of lactic acid, especially the SCOBY treated samples, which is an indicator of fermentation. There is potential for optimization of the seaweed fermentation process through strain selection, fermentation conditions optimization (temperature, time, pH) and seaweed biomass pretreatment. Glutamic acid, the amino acid responsible for umami flavour, was found in greater quantities in the S. cerevisiae treated seaweed, indicating that fermentation using S. cerevisiae cultures may improve the umami flavour profile of a seaweed fermented beverage product. In order to see if the seaweed species used had an impact on the SCOBY microbial makeup, the DNA profiles of the two SCOBYs used were analyzed. There were significant differences between the two SCOBYs. The A. esculenta SCOBY showed slightly rarer species of fungi and the species abundance of fungi was greater than that of S. latissima SCOBY. Furthermore, the number of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in A. esculenta SCOBY was higher than that in S. latissima SCOBY. This study shows the potential of using brown seaweed species as a fermentation substrate to develop a novel, fermented beverage.","2023-11-01","2024-01-21 21:05:56","2024-02-09 00:14:39","2024-01-21 21:05:56","103322","","","76","","Algal Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","Brown seaweed fermentation; Kombucha; Lactic acid bacteria; Lactiplantibacillus plantarum; Novel food product development; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; SCOBY; Seaweed fermentation; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We here explored the potential of utilizing the sugar alcohol mannitol and seaweed extract (SWE) containing mannitol, as alternative feedstocks for production of chemicals by fermentation using B. methanolicus. Extracts of the brown algae Saccharina latissima harvested in the Trondheim Fjord in Norway were prepared and found to contain 12–13 g/l of mannitol, with conductivities corresponding to a salt content of ∼2% NaCl. Initially, 12 B. methanolicus wild type strains were tested for tolerance to various SWE concentrations, and some strains including MGA3 could grow on 50% SWE medium. Non-methylotrophic and methylotrophic growth of B. methanolicus rely on differences in regulation of metabolic pathways, and we compared production titers of GABA and cadaverine under such growth conditions. Shake flask experiments showed that recombinant MGA3 strains could produce similar and higher titers of cadaverine during growth on 50% SWE and mannitol, compared to on methanol. GABA production levels under these conditions were however low compared to growth on methanol. We present the first fed-batch mannitol fermentation of B. methanolicus and production of 6.3 g/l cadaverine. Finally, we constructed a recombinant MGA3 strain synthesizing the C30 terpenoids 4,4′-diaponeurosporene and 4,4′-diapolycopene, experimentally confirming that B. methanolicus has a functional methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway.

To improve silage quality, Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta biomass was subjected to ensiling conditions following a 2 × 4 factorial design, with 2 prewilting treatments (no-prewilting and prewilted to 300 g DM kg−1 fresh biomass) and 4 additive treatments (no additive, formic acid, single and two species of Lactobacillus inoculant), and ensiled for 3 or 12 months at 15 °C. Acetate was the main fermentation product in these seaweed silages. Prewilting reduced the acetate, mannitol, and NH3 content in silages. In S. latissima silages without additives, prewilting led to less acidification (pH = 5.7). Also, prewilting caused protein and phlorotannin degradation. When treated with formic acid, the silage pH was below 4 regardless of the biomass’s moisture content. The use of Lactobacillus spp. inoculants was essential for lactate production in seaweed silages, and it significantly lowered silage pH in S. latissima and prewilted A. esculenta compared to silages with no additives. A high level of the phlorotannin content was preserved (> 90%) in the 3-month A. esculenta silages without prewilting. However, major reduction of antioxidant activity was observed in 12-month silages in both seaweed species. In conclusion, ensiling is a viable method for preserving Alaria and Saccharina biomass. Prewilting restricted silage fermentation, and both formic acid and bacterial additives facilitated silage acidification. However, there was no clear benefit of these treatments in preserving the antioxidant activity.","2022-02-01","2024-01-21 21:41:52","2024-02-09 00:14:12","2024-01-21 21:41:52","625-636","","1","34","","J Appl Phycol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","Alaria esculenta; Antioxidant activity; Chemical composition; Macroalgae; Phlorotannin; Saccharina latissima; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In situ temporal and spatial variation","","","","","https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/20519","The motivation for macroalgal cultivation is to meet the global demand for food, energy and biomaterials for a rapidly growing human population in the context of the challenges of limited terrestrial food resources. Over the last 20 years the interest in seaweed cultivation has increased in European countries, and the kelp <i>Saccharina latissima</i> is one of the best-suited species for cultivation in North Atlantic waters. Epibiosis on cultivated seaweed in mid and high latitudes usually occurs from spring to summer, forcing the farmers to harvest the seaweed biomass before it reaches its potential maximum and higher carbohydrate content. Therefore, epibiosis is considered one of the main challenges in industrial seaweed farming. There has been a lack of knowledge about timing and species fouling cultivated <i>S. latissima</i> under different environmental conditions, including different latitudes, seasons and depths, as well as sporophyte age and nutritional history. This topic was investigated through three in situ studies, one with a large latitudinal range covering eleven degrees in latitude, one smaller-scale study within a geographical region characterized by differing environmental characteristics, and one with different outplanting dates resulting in various sporophyte ages within the same location at a given calendar date. The papers that this thesis is built upon show that there is spatial variability in phenology, degree and density of epibiosis on multiple scales on cultivated <i>S. latissima</i>. The present study has increased our knowledge about one of the bottlenecks for seaweed cultivation; epibiosis. Furthermore, this new fundamental understanding of timing and species diversity of epibiosis on cultivated <i>S. latissima</i> contributes to an overall understanding of the fouling issue along the Norwegian coast, enabling a broader view with important implications for the seaweed industry.","2021-03-04","2024-01-21 21:42:17","2024-02-09 00:56:00","2024-01-21 21:42:17","","","","","","","","","","","","UiT The Arctic University of Norway","","eng","openAccess","Doctoral thesis","","","munin.uit.no","","Accepted: 2021-02-05T09:41:57Z ISBN: 9788282661928","","","","zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates benthic degradation of kelp detritus in defaunated mesocosms. The degradation dynamics were investigated over several weeks by resolving O2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes as a function of detritus amendments (0.15 g wet weight [WW] m-2 to 1 kg WW m-2), temperature (8 and 15°C), and presence of O2 for 2 commercially important kelp species: Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta. Kelp fragments were deposited in 2 different ways to simulate oxic and anoxic degradation: on the sediment surface (surface amendments) and just below the oxic surface sediment layer (subsurface amendments). All amendments resulted in high initial O2 consumption followed by an exponential decrease in O2 uptake over time. The degradation rates increased linearly with the amount of kelp added for both species and for both types of amendments. S. latissima expressed higher decay constants across all experiments and had a higher percentage turnover of carbon. In some instances, microbial priming apparently enabled enhanced degradation of pre-existing resilient sedimentary carbon. The absolute degradation rates of kelp were reduced in the absence of O2, and sulfate reduction resulted in gradual accumulation of iron sulfide. Lower ambient temperature reduced the benthic mineralization rate of both kelp species, particularly during the initial incubation stages. The current study demonstrates the importance of key variables for microbial kelp degradation in marine sediments and their dynamics—variables that should be carefully considered when assessing environmental implications of seaweed farming.","2023-04-13","2024-01-21 21:44:27","2024-02-09 00:12:36","2024-01-21 21:44:27","1-15","","","709","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.int-res.com","","","","; ","https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps%E2%82%92a/m709p001.pdf; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:RbN3bNJjuTYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Elo=2020","Benthic fluxes; biodegradation; biomineralization; carbon cycle; detritus; dissolved inorganic carbon; Kelp detritus; microbial activity; Microbial degradation; Microbial priming; seaweed; Seaweed cultivation; sulfate; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its economic and ecological interest, only a few data are available on the composition of microbiota associated with S. latissima and its role in algal physiologyn.MethodsWe studied the whole bacterial community composition associated with S. latissima samples from three locations (Brittany, Helgoland, and Skagerrak) by 16S metabarcoding analyses at different scales: algal blade part, regions, season (at one site), and algal physiologic state.Results and DiscussionWe have shown that the difference in bacterial composition is driven by factors of decreasing importance: (i) the algal tissues (apex/meristem), (ii) the geographical area, (iii) the seasons (at the Roscoff site), and (iv) the algal host’s condition (healthy vs. symptoms). Overall, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia dominated the general bacterial communities. Almost all individuals hosted bacteria of the genus Granulosicoccus, accounting for 12% of the total sequences, and eight additional core genera were identified. Our results also highlight a microbial signature characteristic for algae in poor health independent of the disease symptoms. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the S. latissima microbiome, forming a basis for understanding holobiont functioning.","2023","2024-01-21 21:46:59","2024-02-08 23:55:26","2024-01-27 20:51:33","","","","13","","","The Saccharina latissima microbiome","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","; ","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1050939/full; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:BaouJBZRupUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Elo=2020","Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Alteromonadaceae; analysis of variance; Article; Bacteroidetes; Bacteroidia; brown macroalgae; DNA 16S; DNA barcoding; DNA extraction; ecosystem; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; holobiont; macroalga; metabarcoding; microbial community; microbiota; natural population; nonhuman; other_source; Proteobacteria; Saccharina latissima; sequence analysis; Tenacibaculum; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we combined high throughput Illumina-based DNA sequencing and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization to perform a culture-independent investigation of the S. latissima bacterial and fungal microbiota. Up to 600 bacterial and 100 fungal Amplicon Sequence Variants were identified per algal individual, revealing diverse bacterial and fungal communities associated to S. latissima. Overall, bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, in particular Hyphomonadaceae and Cyclobacteriaceae. Fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, in particular Mycosphaerellaceae, Psathyrellaceae, and Bulleribasidiaceae. Our results also revealed a variable distribution of S. latissima microbiota, as two adjacent tissue samples typically contained distinct fungal and bacterial assemblages, and CARD-FISH analysis detected microbial endosymbionts (with a few epibionts). Complementary analyses showed that despite achieving a good sequencing coverage for each tissue sample, the unexpected diversity and variability of ASVs made the definition of a core fungal and bacterial microbiota difficult, and highlights novel avenues to overcome the limitations of current surface-sterilization and metabarcoding protocols.","2020","2024-01-27 20:54:14","2024-02-08 23:56:13","2024-01-27 20:54:14","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","; ","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.587566/full; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:H%3Csub%3EX%3C/sub%3EOthMHZJkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Elo=2020","algae; bacteria; biofilm; endophyte; fungi; holobiont; microbiota; other_source; Saccharina latissima; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ecosystem engineers contribute significantly to global primary production and are the major habitat formers on rocky shores in temperate waters, providing food and shelter for aquatic life. Like other eukaryotic organisms, macroalgae harbor a rich diversity of associated microorganisms with functions related to host health and defense. In particular, epiphytic bacterial communities have been reported as essential for normal morphological development of the algal host, and bacteria with antifouling properties are thought to protect chemically undefended macroalgae from detrimental, secondary colonization by other microscopic and macroscopic epibiota. This tight relationship suggests that macroalgae and epiphytic bacteria interact as a unified functional entity or holobiont, analogous to the previously suggested relationship in corals. Moreover, given that the impact of diseases in marine ecosystems is apparently increasing, understanding the role of bacteria as saprophytes and pathogens in seaweed communities may have important implications for marine management strategies. This review reports on the recent advances in the understanding of macroalgal–bacterial interactions with reference to the diversity and functional role of epiphytic bacteria in maintaining algal health, highlighting the holobiont concept.","2013-05-01","2024-01-27 21:14:16","2024-02-08 23:55:15","2024-01-27 21:14:15","462-476","","3","37","","FEMS Microbiology Reviews","The seaweed holobiont","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","; ","https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-pdf/37/3/462/18143217/37-3-462.pdf; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Jl5uEa-Y6bMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Ehi=2019","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated the survival of four pathogens inoculated onto two product forms of sugar kelp subjected to different storage temperatures. The inoculation comprised of a cocktail of two Listeria monocytogenes and STEC strains, two Salmonella serovars, and two Vibrio species. STEC and Vibrio were grown and applied in salt-containing media to simulate preharvest contamination, whereas L. monocytogenes and Salmonella inocula were prepared to simulate postharvest contamination. Samples were stored at 4°C and 10°C for 7 days, and 22°C for 8 h. Microbiological analyses were performed periodically (1, 4, 8, 24 h, etc.) to evaluate the effects of storage temperature on pathogen survival. Pathogen populations decreased under all storage conditions, but survival was greatest for all species at 22°C, with STEC exhibiting significantly less reduction (1.8 log CFU/g) than Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and Vibrio (3.1, 2.7, and 2.7 log CFU/g, respectively) after storage. The largest population reduction (5.3 log CFU/g) was observed in Vibrio stored at 4°C for 7 days. Regardless of storage temperature, all pathogens remained detectable at the end of the study duration.

Results showed firstly the taxonomic grouping of macroalgae does not explain the composition and structure of the EBCs. Secondly, the methodology used is important for describing EBCs; and thirdly, multiple bacteria can have the same function and thus to describe the functionality of EBCs it is important to recognize host-specific and generalist bacteria. We recommend the incorporation of a complementary approach between the taxonomic composition and the functional composition analyzes of EBCs, as well as the use of methodological tools that allow analysis of interactions between the EBCs and their hosts, based on the “holobiont” concept.","2017","2024-01-27 21:28:25","2024-02-09 00:15:07","2024-01-27 21:28:25","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","; ","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02561/full; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:7viKzqh2VeIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Ehi=2019","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blade quality can be compromised by attached organisms – epibionts. Biweekly examination of epibionts on sugar kelp was conducted April–May 2018, on a kelp farm in eastern Long Island Sound, CT, USA. Culturable Vibrio spp. were not present on kelp blades until May and were limited to only old sections. No Vibrio colonies were human pathogens V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus, based upon ToxR-specific multiplex PCR assays. Neither epibenthic cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. nor the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, microbes of concern because of toxigenicity, were detected on kelp by microscopy or metabarcoding of partial rRNA genes. The lacy bryozoan was the only epibiotic animal observed that could cause damage to kelp, but its abundance was low. Summarizing most-common sequence reads, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial group on kelp blades (49%) and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant in seawater (39%). Bacillariophyta were the most abundant eukaryotes on kelp blades (36%) and Dinoflagellata were the most abundant eukaryotes in seawater (43%). Molecular operational taxonomic unit matrices were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling; the most prominent structure for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities was the separation between blade and seawater samples. This spatial separation explained 81% and 76% of the variation among prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, respectively. Indicator Species Analysis identified Gammaproteobacteria (55%) and Bacillariophyta (56%) to be the most important blade indicator prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. A closer examination of indicator species temporal patterns and their ecophysiology suggested that Aquimarina, Parcubacteria, and Peronosporomycetes are potential pathogens to sugar kelp.

The kelp microbiome could support the burgeoning kelp cultivation sector by improving host growth, stress tolerance, and resistance to disease. Fundamental questions about the cultivated kelp microbiome still need to be addressed before microbiome-based approaches can be developed. A critical knowledge gap is how cultivated kelp microbiomes change as hosts grow, particularly following outplanting to sites that vary in abiotic conditions and microbial source pools. In this study we assessed if microbes that colonize kelp in the nursery stage persist after outplanting. We characterized microbiome succession over time on two species of kelp, Alaria marginata and Saccharina latissima, outplanted to open ocean cultivation sites in multiple geographic locations. We tested for host-species specificity of the microbiome and the effect of different abiotic conditions and microbial source pools on kelp microbiome stability during the cultivation process. We found the microbiome of kelp in the nursery is distinct from that of outplanted kelp. Few bacteria persisted on kelp following outplanting. Instead, we identified significant microbiome differences correlated with host species and microbial source pools at each cultivation site. Microbiome variation related to sampling month also indicates that seasonality in host and/or abiotic factors may influence temporal succession and microbiome turnover in cultivated kelps. This study provides a baseline understanding of microbiome dynamics during kelp cultivation and highlights research needs for applying microbiome manipulation to kelp cultivation.","2023","2024-01-27 21:34:59","2024-02-08 23:56:29","2024-02-04 18:38:24","538-551","","3","59","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

Ectocarpus siliculosus is a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. Here we use this model to start disentangling the complex interactions that may occur between the algal host and its associated bacteria. We report the genome-sequencing of 10 alga-associated bacteria and the genome-based reconstruction of their metabolic networks. The predicted metabolic capacities were then used to identify metabolic complementarities between the algal host and the bacteria, highlighting a range of potentially beneficial metabolite exchanges between them. These putative exchanges allowed us to predict consortia consisting of a subset of these ten bacteria that would best complement the algal metabolism. Finally, co-culture experiments were set up with a subset of these consortia to monitor algal growth as well as the presence of key algal metabolites. Although we did not fully control but only modified bacterial communities in our experiments, our data demonstrated a significant increase in algal growth in cultures inoculated with the selected consortia. In several cases, we also detected, in algal extracts, the presence of key metabolites predicted to become producible via an exchange of metabolites between the alga and the microbiome. Thus, although further methodological developments will be necessary to better control and understand microbial interactions in Ectocarpus, our data suggest that metabolic complementarity is a good indicator of beneficial metabolite exchanges in the holobiont.","2020","2024-02-04 18:45:55","2024-02-09 00:12:57","2024-02-04 18:45:55","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across the Mediterranean Sea, this toxic microalga has been shown to thrive on the surface of various species of macroalgae, including Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyceae. Interestingly, some Dictyotaceae are characterized by a low abundance of cells of O. cf. ovata on their surface. Based on the antifouling properties of some specialized metabolites produced by seaweeds, macroalgal metabolites have been proposed to contribute to the settlement and development of O. cf. ovata. To address this question, the composition of the surface of four Dictyotaceae, Dictyota dichotoma, Dictyota spiralis, Taonia atomaria, and Padina pavonica was investigated through an integrative approach combining the analysis of their eukaryotic diversity (18S rRNA gene metabarcoding), their surface metabolome (untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics) as well as the bioactivity of their surface extracts on O. cf. ovata. Altogether, the data suggest an influence of the macroalgal surface chemistry on the growth of the dinoflagellate, with D. dichotoma being the most bioactive. Some metabolites are proposed to be involved in the observed bioactivity. Other biotic factors are also likely to be entailed in the control of the O. cf. ovata population and they may even prevail on the influence of the macroalgal surface chemistry.","2020","2024-02-04 18:47:05","2024-02-09 00:20:37","2024-02-04 18:47:05","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding community organization of microalgal microbiomes, such as how algal species identity influences bacterial community structure, will aid in efforts to engineer more efficient phototrophic ecosystems. Here, we examined the community assembly of phycosphere-associated (attached) and free-living bacterial taxa associated with two marine microalgae: the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and eustigmatophyte Microchloropsis salina. Samples were collected from outdoor mesocosms, raceway ponds, and laboratory enrichments, and bacterial taxa identified by 16S rRNA gene sequences. In outdoor mesocosms, we found distinct bacterial taxa associated with each algal species, including the Cytophagaceae and Rhodobacteraceae families with P. tricornutum, and Rhodobacteraceae, Hyphomonadaceae, and Saprospiraceae with M. salina. Additionally, there were host-specific differences in the bacterial genera associated with the phycosphere, including Novosphingobium and Rhodopirellula with P. tricornutum, and Methylophaga and Dyadobacter with M. salina. Bacterial communities from outdoor monoalgal P. tricornutum and polyalgal P. tricornutum/M. salina samples were used as inocula for laboratory enrichments with axenic P. tricornutum. Here, similar bacterial communities emerged, suggesting that the algal host exerts substantial influence over bacterial community assembly. Further enrichments for phycosphere-association revealed differing outcomes of community assembly processes contingent on the initial community composition. Phycosphere-associated communities from monoalgal P. tricornutum mesocosms were highly similar to one another, suggesting deterministic processes, whereas cultures from mixed M. salina/P. tricornutum raceways followed two apparent paths differentiated by the stochastic loss of specific community members and convergence towards or further deviation from the monoalgal samples. These results demonstrate that algal-associated bacterial communities are controlled by algal host, culture conditions, and the initial inoculum composition of the algal microbiome, and this knowledge can inform the engineering of more productive algal systems.","2019-06-01","2024-02-04 18:51:41","2024-02-08 21:59:38","2024-02-04 18:51:41","101489","","","40","","Algal Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bacterial enrichment cultures supplemented with chlorinated aliphatic compounds, typically released by marine algae, were established using as inoculum the decaying biomass of the three macroalgae, obtaining a collection of 634 bacterial strains. Although collected from the same site and exposed to the same seawater seeding microbiota, macroalgal cultivable bacterial communities in terms of functional and phylogenetic diversity showed host specificity. Isolates were tested for the hydrolysis of starch, pectin, alginate and agar, exhibiting a different hydrolytic potential according to their host: A. taxiformis showed the highest percentage of active isolates (91%), followed by S. coronopifolius (54%) and H. scoparia (46%). Only 30% of the isolates were able to degrade starch, while the other polymers were degraded by 55–58% of the isolates. Interestingly, several isolates showed promiscuous capacities to hydrolyze more than one polysaccharide.

In recent years, several researchers have studied the diversity and function of the epiphytic bacteria associated with algal host, but largely these interactions remain underexplored. In the present study we analysed the cultivable diversity and polymer degradation potential of epiphytic bacteria associated with five different marine macroalgae (Sargassum, Ulva, Padina, Dictyota and Pterocladia sp.) sampled from the central west coast of India. Out of the total 360 strains isolated, purified and preserved, about 238 strains were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and processed for polymer (cellulose, pectin, xylan and starch) degrading activities. Phylogeny placed the strains within the classes Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Alpha-proteobacteria, and Gamma-proteobacteria and clustered them into 45 genera, wherein Vibrio, Bacillus, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, Staphylococcus and Kocuria spp. were the most abundant with 20 strains identified as potentially novel taxa within the genera Bacillus, Cellulosimicrobium, Gordonia, Marinomonas, Vibrio, Luteimonas and Pseudoalteromonas. In terms of polymer hydrolysis potential, 61.3% had xylanase activity, while 59.7%, 58.8%, and 52.2% had amylase, cellulase, and pectinase activity, respectively. Overall, 75.6% of the strains degraded more than one polysaccharide, 24% degraded all polymers, while nine strains (3.8%) degraded raw sugarcane bagasse.

Given there are thousands of bacteria-host associations, determining which relationships are important remains a major challenge. We characterised the associated bacteria of two habitat-forming kelp species, Laminaria hyperborea and Saccharina latissima, from eight sites across a range of spatial scales (10 s of metres to 100 s of km) in the northeast Atlantic. We found no difference in diversity or community structure between the two kelps, but there was evidence of regional structuring (across 100 s km) and considerable variation between individuals (10 s of metres). Within sites, individuals shared few amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and supported a very small proportion of diversity found across the wider study area. However, consistent characteristics between individuals were observed with individual host communities containing a small conserved “core” (8–11 ASVs comprising 25 and 32% of sample abundances for L. hyperborea and S. latissima, respectively). At a coarser taxonomic resolution, communities were dominated by four classes (Planctomycetes, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia) that made up ~ 84% of sample abundances. Remaining taxa (47 classes) made up very little contribution to overall abundance but the majority of taxonomic diversity. Overall, our study demonstrates the consistent features of kelp bacterial communities across large spatial scales and environmental gradients and provides an ecologically meaningful baseline to track environmental change.","2023-05-01","2024-02-04 19:01:39","2024-02-09 00:22:21","2024-02-04 19:01:38","1265-1275","","4","85","","Microb Ecol","Consistency and Variation in the Kelp Microbiota","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","; ","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-022-02038-0; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:rbXyuy34cNkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Elo=2020","Bacteria; bacterium; Core microbiome; ecosystem; Ecosystem; forest; Forests; genetics; Holobiont; human; Humans; kelp; Kelp; Laminaria; Laminaria hyperborea; microbiology; Microbiota; microflora; other_source; Saccharina latissima; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we studied the microbiomes of Ulva australis and Ulva lacinulata, three natural populations and an aquaculture set-up, based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. The microbiome of cultivated Ulva was pronouncedly different from natural populations, and was specifically associated with higher relative abundances of known growth-promoting bacteria Sulfitobacter and Roseobacter. On a smaller scale, there were species-specific differences as well. In general, Ulva-associated communities were highly distinct from environmental seawater and sediment reference samples. We demonstrated a workflow generating full-length 16S rRNA sequences in real-time using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We compared 3 different reference databases to assign taxonomy with Kraken2 (SILVA, Greengenes and NCBI). In addition, we used Nanopore's cloud-based EPI2ME workflow for comparison. All four methods yielded comparable results in terms of relative abundances on phylum and order level, but differed widely in alpha diversity indices at genus level. Using the NCBI 16S database, especially in combination with the EPI2ME workflow, resulted in a high proportion of false identifications of cyanobacteria due to chloroplast contamination.

The microbial biofilm itself acts as a biological defence mechanism to prevent the establishment of pathogenic microbes as well as to protect the surface of the seaweed from the macrofoulers. In most cases, the presence and diversity of these organisms are host-specific. The macroalgal host and their associated microbiont are often referred to as a ‘Holobiont’. The surface-associated microbiome of macroalgae plays a crucial role in the growth, morphogenesis and defence in the normal favourable environmental conditions of the macroalgae (Symbiotism). Whereas, when there is a change i.e. reversed, unfavourable conditions, the microbiome reverses its symbiotic nature and affects growth and degrades the macroalgae by causing different diseases in different species. In parallel, marine macroalgae employ different defence mechanisms, a physical defence such as continuous shedding of the outer layer of cells, and the mucilaginous covering and chemical defence such as the production of secondary metabolites.

So there is a growing concern to find other safe, non-antibiotic based and eco-friendly alternative for the treatment of the diseases. The use of probiotics is a promising alternative approach for the control of infectious agents and treatment of diseases. The benefits of probiotic include stimulation of growth, improved digestion, enhanced immune response and recuperate the water quality as well. Probiotics concoct the fish to fight against various pathogens and improves the overall health as they show anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties. The use of probiotics in aquaculture is a recent trend and its efficacy in aquatic environment has not been studied extensively. This review paper provides the current knowledge of the use of probiotics in aquaculture, selection criteria, types of probiotics used in aquaculture, their mode of action and administrative methods of probiotics in aquaculture.","2019-02-01","2024-02-04 19:13:57","2024-02-09 00:07:16","2024-02-04 19:13:57","99-113","","2","77","","Symbiosis","Probiotics in aquaculture","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","Antibiotics; Carp; other_source; Prebiotics; Putative probiotics; Quorum sensing; Synbiotics; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, today we do not know how environmental stress will affect the macroalgal holobiont in an increasingly changing ocean.

Here we use fluorescence and electron microscopy as well as 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis to investigate symbiont transmission in members of the three major seaweed groups (green Chlorophyta, red Rhodophyta and brown Phaeophyceae). We found seaweeds employ diverse strategies to transfer symbionts to their progeny. For instance, the green Ulva australis does not appear to have the capacity for vertical transmission. In contrast, the brown Phyllospora comosa adopts a non-selective vertical transmission. The red Delisea pulchra demonstrates weak selectivity in symbiont transmission, while the brown Hormosira banksii exhibits a strongly selective symbiont transfer. Mucilage on the gametes appears to facilitate vertical transmission and transferred bacteria have predicted properties that could support early development of the seaweeds. Previous meta-analysis has indicated that vertical transmission is rare in aquatic compared to terrestrial environments, however, our results contribute to the growing evidence that this might not be the case and that instead vertical transmission with various degrees of symbiont selection occurs in the ecologically important group of seaweeds.","2024","2024-02-04 19:17:17","2024-02-09 00:11:17","2024-02-04 19:17:17","e16564","","1","26","","","Not all parents are the same","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

This study comprehensively characterized the epiphytic bacterial communities associated with eight different common seaweeds collected from a rocky intertidal zone on the Indian Ocean at Cape Vidal, South Africa. High-throughput sequencing analyses indicated that seaweed-associated bacterial communities were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed the presence of elemental composition in the surface of examined seaweeds, in varying concentrations. Cluster analysis showed that bacterial communities of brown seaweeds (SW2 and SW4) were closely resembled those of green seaweeds (SW1) and red seaweeds (SW7) while those of brown seaweeds formed a separate branch. Predicted functional capabilities of epiphytic bacteria using PICRUSt analysis revealed abundance of genes related to metabolic and biosynthetic activities. Further important identified functional interactions included genes for bacterial chemotaxis, which could be responsible for the observed association and network of elemental-microbes interaction. The study concludes that the diversity of epiphytic bacteria on seaweed surfaces is greatly influenced by algal organic exudates as well as elemental deposits on their surfaces, which triggers chemotaxis responses from epiphytic bacteria with the requisite genes to metabolise those substrates.","2019-12-27","2024-02-04 19:22:02","2024-02-09 00:21:53","2024-02-04 19:22:02","19835","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","Ecological networks; Microbial ecology; Molecular ecology; other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The function of macroalgae is intimately linked to the composition and structure of their epibiotic bacterial, communities, and evidence has emerged that bacteria can also have a negative impact on their host by causing disease. A few examples exist where bacteria have been unambiguously linked to macroalgal disease, however in many cases, pathogenicity has not been clearly separated from saprophytic behaviour or secondary colonization after disease initiation. Nevertheless, pathogenic pressure by bacteria might be substantial, as macroalgae have evolved a range of innate and induced defence mechanism that have the potential to control bacterial attacks. The presence and abundance of virulence factors in marine bacteria, which have not previously been recognized as pathogens, also represents an underappreciated, opportunistic potential for disease. Given that virulence expression in opportunistic pathogens is often dependent on environmental conditions, we predict that current and future anthropogenic changes in the marine environment will lead to an increase in the occurrence of macroalgal disease. This review highlights important areas of research that require future attention to understand the link between environmental change, opportunistic pathogens and macroalgal health in the world's oceans.","2014","2024-02-04 19:36:49","2024-02-09 00:23:49","2024-02-04 19:36:49","925-938","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2013 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1462-2920.12288","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, simultaneous comparative studies on the biodiversity and functions of epiphytic bacteria and fungi associated with marine macrophytes have not been conducted. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to describe the epiphytic bacterial and fungal communities of 11 common macroalgae and 2 seagrasses from an intertidal zone of northern China and compare them with seawater communities. The results showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota were the dominant bacterial phyla in marine macrophytes, whereas Ascomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla. The alpha diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities in seagrasses was the highest of all macrophyte samples. This may have been related to their ability to recruit microorganisms from multiple sources. Host phylogeny may influence bacterial community structure, and geographical differences may influence fungal community structure. The FAPROTAX data indicated that C metabolic microbes were enriched in marine macrophytes, while the FUNGuild data indicated that undefined saprotroph, which participated in organic matter degradation, were also enriched in marine macrophytes. These findings provide a theoretical basis regarding the epiphytic microorganisms of macrophytes and may offer new insights to support the improved ecological restoration of seagrass and macroalgae beds.","2022","2024-02-04 19:40:26","2024-02-09 00:22:23","2024-02-04 19:40:25","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seaweed samples supplied from Scotland were stored under isothermal conditions for specific time intervals depending on the sample’s condition (fresh, dried or rehydrated). During storage, microbiological analyses were performed for the enumeration of Total Viable Counts (TVC), Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp., as well as yeasts and molds. Additionally, bacterial colonies from the Marine Agar growth medium were isolated and subjected to PCR-RAPD analysis for characterization of the bacterial diversity of seaweeds. Bacterial isolates with different fingerprint patterns were further subjected to sequencing (16S rDNA, V1–V4 region). The presence of human pathogenic bacteria was also investigated. Results showed that the initial population of TVC was differentiated depending on the year of seaweed harvest, being closer to the enumeration limit (1.0 log CFU/g) in fresh samples from 2020 and higher in samples from 2019 (6.7 and 3.9 log CFU/g in A. esculenta and S. latissima, respectively).

They have a number of interactions with bacteria and other organisms such as fouling and disease. To inhibit the settling, growing, and biofilm formation by bacteria, it has been suggested that the macroalgae influence bacterial metabolism and quorum sensing through the production of secondary metabolites with antibiotic effect. Macroalgae-bacteria interactions have been investigated for many years. These interactions can be beneficial when the bacteria assist with the normal development of macroalgae as well as reducing secondary fouling on the algal surface. On the other hand, the interactions may have a deleterious effect when the biofilm impairs the photosynthetic ability or promotes disease development. This review reports the recent advances in the understanding of bacteria-brown algae interactions, highlighting the diversity and functional role of epiphytic bacteria, including the maintenance of the health of the algae and the biological activities described from this association. Through combined bacterial culture, microscopy, and molecular biology, it has been possible to identify and establish the phylogenetic origin of different bacterial communities associated with brown algae, being predominantly the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Further investigation of the bacterial communities that live on different macroalgae using new technologies are still required, mainly to evaluate the production and secretions of metabolites with biotechnological potential.","2019-04-01","2024-02-04 19:44:31","2024-02-09 00:07:27","2024-02-04 19:44:31","867-883","","2","31","","J Appl Phycol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","; ","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-018-1573-4; https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:RSGDRkv6tSwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Ehi=2019","Biofilms; Biological activity; Chemical interaction; Microbial ecology; other_source; Secondary metabolites; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized bacterial and archaeal communities associated with giant kelp in the Santa Barbara Channel. Our results indicate that kelp-associated microbial communities are altered in the presence of epiphytic bryozoans and reflect changes previously observed in other studies of stressed macroalgae. This observation is indicative of patterns of microbiome disruption (dysbiosis) and opportunistic pathogenesis that may have implications for the health and productivity of foundational species of macroalgae. Our study highlights new patterns in host–microbiome associations and reveals the importance of considering host source and condition when investigating the dynamics of macroalgal microbiomes.","2020","2024-02-04 18:48:08","2024-02-09 00:14:28","2024-02-04 18:48:08","","","5","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to adapt known methods for food-quality determination for the analysis of seaweed quality, including color, texture, and microbiology, and to discuss optimal heat treatments for the popular macroalgae Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta. Results: The development of an attractive, green color during heating was highly specific to species, freezing history, and part of the thallus. Resilience and thermostability were also species dependent. Low microbial numbers (1–3 log cfu/g) for total aerobic count, psychrotrophic bacteria, and spore-forming bacteria were found, but Bacillus spp. were isolated. No enterococci, coliforms, pathogenic vibrios, or Listeria monocytogenes were detected. Conclusion: The methods employed were able to describe clearly the physical and microbial qualities of A. esculenta and S. latissima, and quality changes during processing. Based on the results, optimal cooking for a minimum of 15 min at 95 °C was suggested for S. latissima. Fresh and frozen A. esculenta showed the greenest color after heating for 5–9 s at a high temperature (> 85 °C). If a higher heat load is needed to achieve safe and stable food products, using fresh and not frozen A. esculenta is highly recommended, as fresh specimens remain green even after 15 min at 95 °C. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","2019","2024-02-08 14:53:42","2024-02-09 00:24:18","","1198-1206","","3","99","","J.

Microbial communities on algae remain underexplored, however, despite their huge biodiversity and the fact that they differ markedly from those living freely in seawater. The study of this microbiota and of its relationships with algal hosts should provide crucial information for ecological investigations on algae and aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, because these microorganisms interact with algae in multiple, complex ways, they constitute an interesting source of novel bioactive compounds with biotechnological potential, such as dehalogenases, antimicrobials, and alga-specific polysaccharidases (e.g., agarases, carrageenases, and alginate lyases). Here, to demonstrate the huge potential of alga-associated organisms and their metabolites in developing future biotechnological applications, we first describe the immense diversity and density of these microbial biofilms. We further describe their complex interactions with algae, leading to the production of specific bioactive compounds and hydrolytic enzymes of biotechnological interest.

Antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH method and the activity ranged from 0.00 to 2641.34 TEAC. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in kombu (2641.34 TEAC) and arame (2457.5 TEAC). Antimicrobial activity was analyzed by disk diffusion method and MIC method. Three G+ bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus sub-tilis), three G‐ bacteria (Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), and four yeasts (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. albicans) were used as model organisms. The size of inhibition zones ranged from 0.00 to 8.67 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the selected seaweeds ranged from MIC50 98.46 (MIC90 100.25) to MIC50 3.43 μL/mL (MIC90 5.26 μL/mL). The content of selected elements was determined in seaweed samples by ICP‐OES. The chemical composition of the algae showed differences between species and the presence of heavy metals. Arsenic, cadmium, and aluminum were confirmed. All seaweed samples contained arsenic ranging from 6.6546 to 76.48 mg/kg. Further investigation of seaweeds is needed to identify the active sub-stances present in the algae that are responsible for antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. This study was carried out to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of extracts from five commonly consumed seaweeds for their ability to inhibit selected microorganisms and to determine the health risk due to heavy metals content. Our study contributes to the evidence that seaweeds have antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and seaweed extracts have for pharmacological appli-cations. © 2022 by the authors.

The biomethane potential and the elemental composition were determined for all samples. Both Fucales species showed low biodegradability (<30%) with methane yields consistently below 20 Nm3 per wet tonne. Laminariales species, however, allowed up to 80% biodegradation efficiency, with methane yields varying between 20 and 70 Nm3 per wet tonne depending on the harvesting season. For each of the four algae the biomass concentrations of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, sulphur, aluminium and iron was higher during spring/summer compared to autumn/winter. For heavy metals, variation was seen mainly for arsenic with higher values during autumn/winter. The highest values were observed for Laminariales (30–120 mg/kg total solids). Modelling the co-digestion of each algae with municipal wastewater sludge showed Laminariales species having the greatest potential as a profitable substrate for additional biomethane production generating up to 0.38 million Euro. However, seasonal variation could affect this expected income over 60% due to fluctuation in biomethane yields and biodegradability efficiency. Furthermore, the additional loading of cadmium and arsenic into the AD process suggested possible limitation for digestate utilisation in arable lands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2024-02-08 14:53:43","2024-02-08 23:57:12","","31-38","","","109","","Biomass Bioenergy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:iM-dJex8pnoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22saccharina+latissima%22%7C%22s+latissima%22%7C%22s+longicruris%22%7C%22saccharina+longicruris%22%7C%22laminaria+saccharina%22%7C%22l+saccharina%22%7C%22sugar+kelp%22%7C%22sea+belt%22%7C%22kombu%22%7C%22devil%27s+apron%22+%22bacter*%22%7C%22microb*%22%7C%22holob*%22%7C%22symbio*%22&hl=en&as%E2%82%9Bdt=2007&as%3Csub%3Ey%3C/sub%3Ehi=2019","Alaria esculenta; Alga composition; algae; Algae; Algae composition; Anaerobic digestion; Arsenic; Ascophyllum nodosum; Biodegradability; biodegradation; Biodegradation; biofuel; Biofuels; biomass; Biomethane; biotechnology; chemical composition; chemical element; efficiency measurement; Element compositions; Energy content; Fucales; Fucus vesiculosus; Heavy metals; Laminariales; Macro-algae; macroalga; methane; Methane; Methane Yield; microbial ecology; Saccharina latissima; seasonal variation; Seasonal variation; seaweed; Seaweed; Substrates; wastewater treatment; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a second study, effects of blanching, freezing, and fermentation on kelp quality were assessed and processed kelp was used to produce sauerkraut. Blanching significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.05) the instrumental kelp a* value and firmness. The a* value negatively correlated with overall liking of salads. To prepare sauerkraut, raw, raw/frozen (−20◦ C), blanched (100◦ C, 1 min), or blanched/frozen kelp were mixed with cabbage, salted, inoculated with starter cultures and fermented. Inconsistent trends in L* values, firmness, and fungi enumeration were observed after fermentation. Consumers evaluated kelp salad (n = 100) and sauerkraut (n = 80) for acceptability. Blanched kelp salad had higher hedonic scores than raw kelp salad. A 100% cabbage sauerkraut control and blanched kelp/cabbage blends were compared; kelp blends were similar to control for appearance, color, and texture but were lower for overall acceptability.

Thus, studying the metabolic expressions of kelp endophytes under different conditions is important to have a better understanding of their impacts on host performance. In this context, fatty acid composition is essential to a given algae fitness and of interest to food web studies either to measure its nutritional quality or to infer about its contribution to consumers diets. In the present study, Paradendryphiella salina, a fungal endophyte was isolated from Saccharina latissima (L.) and Laminaria digitata (Hudson.) and its fatty acid composition was assessed at increasing salinity and temperature conditions. Results showed that fungal composition in terms of fatty acids displayed algal-dependent trajectories in response to temperature increase.

It is necessary to evaluate the safety of industry’s current post-harvest storage and processing methods to ensure the risk of foodborne pathogens on edible seaweed remains low. We evaluated the pathogen load of edible kelp post-harvest under three different storage temperatures (4˚C, 10˚C, 20˚C) and two different drying methods (air- and freeze-drying). The focal pathogens for this research included: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. We tested all six pathogens under each treatment condition on both sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) and rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) as these are the most commonly farmed and wild-harvested species in Maine, respectively. We inoculated a known concentration of pathogen onto freshly harvested kelp, treated it under a storage temperature or drying method, and sampled it over time to determine the impact of treatment on pathogen load. Our results showed that storage at 20˚C can lead to replication while storage at 4˚C and 10˚C halted the replication of focal pathogens. Both air-drying and freeze-drying produced significant log scale reductions in surface pathogen load for all focal pathogens. Additionally, air-drying reduced pathogen load more than freeze-drying for a majority of pathogens and storing dried kelp for 6-weeks further reduced pathogen load across all cases. These results are promising for industry as they corroborate historical evidence that current post-harvest storage and processing conditions are producing products safe for human consumption. © 2023, The Author(s).","2023","2024-02-08 14:53:44","2024-02-09 00:21:30","","1331-1346","","3","35","","J.

Ensiling could be used as a preservation method, but information of its effects on the nutritional value of the seaweed is limited. This study evaluated the in vitro ruminal fermentation of different S. latissima silages using ruminal inoculum either from goats fed a mixed diet (60:40 oat hay:concentrate) or from sheep fed a high-forage diet (90:10 alfalfa hay:concentrate) to simulate different small ruminant production systems. S. latissima was ensiled in vacuum bags without additives (Control), with formic acid (4 g/kg seaweed; FA), with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) or with LAB after a pre-wilting treatment to reach a seaweed dry matter (DM) content of 30% (30LAB). Ensiling S. latissima decreased (p < 0.05) the content in DM, neutral detergent fibre and total extractable polyphenols, but nitrogen and fat content were unaffected. For both ruminal inoculums, ensiling decreased (p < 0.05) the asymptotic gas production after 120 h of fermentation (excepting for FA silage with goats’ inoculum), but the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production was unaffected. The VFA profile shifted towards greater (p < 0.05) acetate and lower (p < 0.05) propionate proportions in all silages compared with the pre-ensiling S. latissima. When goats inoculum was used, greater (p < 0.05) CH4 production compared with pre-ensiling S. latissima was observed in all silages, except Control one, which led to greater (p < 0.05) CH4/total VFA ratio. In contrast, no differences among samples (p > 0.05) in either CH4 production or CH4/total VFA ratio were observed when sheep’ inoculum was used. Fermentation of all samples started earlier with goats’ inoculum than with sheep’ inoculum, which was attributed to the different diet fed to the animals. These results suggest that ensiling S. latissima with either formic acid or lactic acid bacteria could be a viable conservation method to preserve the nutritive value. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2023","2024-02-08 14:53:44","2024-02-09 00:20:57","","308-322","","4","77","","Arch.

Fermentation of seaweeds for generating novel food products has yet only been described for few red algae. Here, sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) was heat-treated and fermented using lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Taste, smell and texture of the fermented product was compared to fresh sugar kelp and two commercial seaweed products (nori and wakame). Tissue contents of dry matter, nitrogen, mannitol, and selected minerals and trace metals of the fresh and fermented sugar kelp were quantified and compared. In the fermentation process, the pH was reduced to 4.5 within 40 h, with LAB counts increasing 100-fold and no Bacillus cereus present. Heat-treatment and fermentation caused a reduced saltiness and umami flavour of the sugar kelp, a less slimy visual appearance and a reduced smell of sea, whereas the texture and protein content was unchanged compared to the fresh sugar kelp. The fermented sugar kelp had a stronger bite than nori and wakame, a stronger smell of sea and a more salty, irony and umami rich taste than nori, but less umami and salt taste than wakame. The fermentation process reduced the contents of sodium (− 15%), cadmium (− 35%) and mercury (− 37%) in the sugar kelp. LAB fermentation of sugar kelp showed promising for broadening the food market for seaweeds as the fermented product had a milder taste, improved visual impression and smell, and a reduced content of harmful trace metals. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2024-02-08 14:53:44","2024-02-08 22:02:02","","3175-3187","","5","31","","J.

Seaweeds were heat treated followed by fermentation with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Kinetics of cell growth, acid production, and sugar consumption were examined. The effects of heating and fermentation on the changes in total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant activity were also monitored. Lactobacillus rhamnosus grew well on both the seaweed species and reached nearly 10 log cfu ml -1 after 16-24 h of fermentation; however, the specific growth rate was 1.5 times higher on S. latissima. Lactic acid was the major product of the fermentation, followed by acetic acid. Heat treatment resulted in a 50-64.4% reduction in TPC and TFC for both the seaweeds concomitant with a leaching of phytochemicals into the water used for heating. Subsequently, fermentation resulted in 28% and 37.6% increases in the TPC and 1.18- and 2.04-fold increases in TFC for S. latissima and Lam. digitata, respectively, with a simultaneous increase in the antioxidant activity as well. Changes in the TPC and TFC were represented by zero-, first-, or second-order kinetic models.

Together with their microbiota, these organisms form a singular entity, the holobiont. Sampling campaigns are required to study the microbiome of algae in natural populations, but freezing samples in liquid nitrogen is complex in the field, particularly at remote locations. Here we tested two simple alternative methods for sampling the microbial diversity associated with the kelp S. latissima: silica gel conservation of tissue and swab samples preserved in DNA/RNA shield solution. We used these techniques to compare apex and meristem samples from Roscoff (Brittany, France) and evaluated their impact on the results of 16S rDNA metabarcoding experiments. Both methods were able to separate apex and meristem microbiomes, and the results were concordant with results obtained for flash-frozen samples. However, differences were observed for several rare genera and ASVs, and the detection of contaminant sequences in the silica gel-preserved samples underline the importance of including blank samples for this method. Globally, our results confirm that the silica gel technique and swabbing combined with DNA/RNA shield preservation are valid alternatives to liquid nitrogen preservation when sampling brown macroalgae in the field. However, they also underline that, regardless of the method, caution should be taken when interpreting data on rare sequences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-02-08 14:53:45","2024-02-09 00:21:22","","","","","63","","Mar.

Within this region, there are no established regulations for farm siting or methods of pathogen detection on macroalgae cultivated or harvested for human consumption. Bacterial pathogens from natural and anthropogenic sources may persist in coastal waters and can potentially contaminate macroalgae. During the winter growing season, sugar kelp Saccharina latissima and adjacent water were sampled from three sites of kelp aquaculture located in adjacent bays of ME, USA. Membrane filtration onto selective media detected Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus in kelp and water samples at all sites, however plate counts were very low. The foodborne pathogens Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, V. parahaemolyticus, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 were detected on enriched kelp samples from 83%, 78%, and 56% of sampling events, respectively, using molecular methods. Even with low bacterial levels, this frequency of detection confirms the risk of foodborne pathogens present on kelp and recommends the development of best management practices to control microbial growth during kelp harvest and processing. Bacterial plate counts from kelp samples often varied from those of water, indicating the importance of sampling the kelp directly, and that the association between bacterial pathogens on kelp and in the surrounding water should be further investigated.

At the same time, protection concepts that are based upon application of biocides are usually not applicable, as such compounds would be rapidly diluted in the sea, causing ecological damage. An alternative concept could be the application of immune stimulants to prevent and control diseases in farmed seaweeds. We here present a pilot study that investigated the effects of oligoalginate elicitation on juvenile and adult sporophytes of Saccharina japonica cultivated in China and on adult sporophytes of Saccharina latissima cultivated in Germany. In two consecutive years, treatment with oligoalginate clearly reduced the detachment of S. japonica juveniles from their substrate curtains during the nursery stage in greenhouse ponds. Oligoalginate elicitation also decreased the density of endobionts and the number of bacterial cells on sporophytes of S. latissima that were cultivated on sea-based rafts. However, the treatment increased the susceptibility of kelp adults to settlement of epibionts (barnacles in Germany and filamentous algal epiphytes in China). In addition, oligoalginate elicitation accelerated the aging of S. japonica adults. Based upon these findings, oligoalginate elicitation could be a feasible way to provide “environmentally friendly” protection of kelp juveniles in nurseries. The same treatment causes not only beneficial, but also unwanted effects in adult kelp sporophytes. Therefore, it is not recommended as a treatment after the juvenile stage is completed. Future tests with other elicitors and other cultivated seaweed species may allow for the development of more feasible applications of targeted defense elicitation in seaweed aquaculture. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2024-02-08 14:53:46","2024-02-09 00:23:16","","1845-1854","","3","31","","J.

In this work, the effect of extracting solvent on the extraction yield, phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and antimicrobial activity of nine brown macroalgae species (Ascophyllum nodosum, Himanthalia elongata, Undaria pinnatifida, Pelvetia canaliculata, Saccharina latissima, Bifurcaria bifurcata, Laminaria ochroleuca, Sargassum muticum, and Fucus spiralis) was assessed. Total phenolic content (TPC) and the antioxidant properties of extracts by different assays: radical scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were performed. The antimicrobial activity of extracts was studied against six different foodborne microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, and Pseudomonas ae-ruginosa. The highest extraction yield was achieved in ethanolic extracts. However, the highest TPC and FRAP values were obtained on the ethyl acetate extracts, especially from A. nodosum. Concern-ing algal species, the highest TPC and FRAP values were found in A. nodosum, while the highest DPPH-RSA values were achieved in the hexane extracts of B. bifurcata. The antimicrobial activity of algal extracts varied according to the solvent and alga selected, suggesting the species-and solvent-dependent behavior of this property, with B. bifurcata extracts showing the highest results for a wide range of bacteria.

Sugar kelp ensiling trials were carried out in lab-scale and pilot-scale with up to one-year duration, by either biological ensiling by means of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation or by chemical ensiling by addition of lactic acid to reduce pH. The results clearly demonstrated that the ensilability of sugar kelp was positively correlated with the initial glucose content which was partly consumed by LAB for obtaining and maintaining low pH. The ensiling process could be optimized by initial addition of molasses and further by addition of commercial LAB inoculum. The dose of molasses was important for pH development during biological ensiling. Similarly, initial addition of lactic acid was important for obtaining an effective chemical ensiling. Biological ensiling reduced the content of native glucose from sugar kelp and increased the content of fermentation products, primarily lactic acid. Addition of either molasses + LAB inoculum or lactic acid reduced the degradation of total amino acids during ensiling. Freezing prior to ensiling hampered the ensiling process but could be compensated for by addition of LAB. In conclusion, ensiling can be used for long-term storage of seaweed biomass, however, the ensiling process alters the biomass composition and, hence, the quality for subsequent use in biorefinery processes. The fate of higher-value components during ensiling needs further investigation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2024-02-08 14:53:47","2024-02-09 00:54:10","","","","","151","","Biomass Bioenergy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Bioconversion; biomass; Biomass; Biomass sugars; Biorefineries; Biorefinery; Biorefining; Brown seaweed; Chemical composition; Chemical compositions; degradation; detection method; Energy storage; fermentation; Fermentation; Glucose; Inocula; Laboratories; Lactic acid; Lactic acid bacteria; Long-term storage; Macro-algae; Macroalgae; pH; Phaeophyceae; Quality; Refining; Saccharina latissima; seaweed; Seaweed; Storage; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultivation of seaweed presents an opportunity, however, a major obstacle is sustainable preservation. Fermentation has been used for centuries to preserve vegetables, e.g., to produce kimchi based on cabbage. This study investigated changes in the microbiota, characteristics (pH, organic acids and water soluble carbohydrates) and food safety of raw shredded Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima during fermentation by the natural microbiota with or without addition of a Lactiplantibacillus plantarum starter culture. The Lb. plantarum fermented products retained a high Shannon diversity index, indicating a partially unsuccessful fermentation. Lb. plantarum performed better in A. esculenta causing pH to drop to below 4.6, a critical limit for control of growth of Clostridium botulinum, within 2 days compared to 7 days for S. latissima. Natural fermentation by the endogenous microbiota resulted in unsafe products with high final pH values (4.8–5.2), presence of unwanted organic acids, such as butyric acid, and in the case of A. esculenta sustenance of inoculated Listeria monocytogenes. Fermentation of A. esculenta and S. latissima by Lb. plantarum is a promising preservation method. However, future work is needed to optimise the process, by investigation of the use of different starter cultures, seaweed pre-treatments (blanching, freezing, etc.) and adjuvants (i.e., addition of sugars, minerals and similar) to promote growth of the starter culture and ensure the fermented products are safe to eat. © 2021 The Author(s)","2021","2024-02-08 14:53:47","2024-02-09 00:07:02","","","","","150","","Food Res.

To sustain and enhance the industry (seaweed growers and processors), it is essential to establish and optimize post-harvest food processing practices to extend the shelf life of the fresh, edible product. Blanching and freezing were applied in this study to offer longer-term storage to enable the distribution of sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima), farm-raised in Maine, USA. The objectives were to evaluate blanching, specifically the impacts of blanching method (direct immersion or vacuum packaged), temperature (80 or 100 °C) and time (5 or 30 s), kelp form (whole blade or shredded), and the effects of frozen storage on food product qualities including color, texture, drip loss, mineral content, total phenolic content, and the native microflora of sugar kelp after thawing. The fresh brown kelp developed a vivid green color immediately after blanching, especially with higher blanching temperature and longer blanching time. Drip loss was higher in blades than in shredded slaw, and vacuum packaged blanching produced higher moisture content, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity. Results substantiate the importance of the blanching method, temperature, and time on frozen kelp quality. Blanching prior to freezing resulted in relatively higher product quality than unblanched frozen kelp despite some losses in hardness and color. Frozen storage had minimal to no impact on texture, aerobic plate count, and psychrotrophic microorganisms. Higher temperature, longer time, and vacuum packaged blanching is suggested to extend the marketable shelf life of sugar kelp to at least 6 months at − 20 °C. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","2022","2024-02-08 14:53:47","2024-02-09 00:21:25","","609-624","","1","34","","J.

The course of silage fermentation for a storage period up to nine weeks was also studied. The characteristics of fresh seaweeds suggested ensiling to be challenging. Overall, seaweeds presented a pH above 7.0, low dry matter (DM) content, and a non-structural polysaccharides content (DM basis) ranging from 14% (U. rigida) to 43% (S. latissima). The highest buffering capacity was recorded for U. rigida while the fermentation coefficient was higher for S. latissima, lower for U. rigida, and intermediate for G. vermiculophylla. The ensiling of S. latissima resulted in a pronounced lactic acid formation and a lower pH in comparison to the red and green seaweed silages. The ensilage of U. rigida and of G. vermiculophylla failed to decrease pH below 5.0 up to nine weeks, fermentation products suggesting the occurrence of a heterolactic fermentation or the promotion of heterofermentative bacteria and clostridia growth, respectively. The use of a lactic acid bacteria inoculant prior to ensiling had only minor effects on fermentation. Composition of seaweeds was generally preserved by ensilage, but in vitro digestibility of G. vermiculophylla was severely reduced.

To determine the influence of different organisms on the decomposition rate (expressed in terms of algal dry weight loss relative to the material present at time zero) and their development during decomposition processes, yeast, flagellates, ciliates, nematodes and a harpacticoid copepod species were introduced to the microcosms. Results show that microbial degradation compared to the controls was enhanced in the presence of non-axenic nematodes (Monhystera sp.) and protozoans, including bacterivorous ciliates (Euplotes sp. and a Uronema-like sp.) and flagellates. No enhancement occurred with yeast (Debaryomyces hansenii) or with the harpacticoid copepod Tisbe holothuriae. The most rapid algal dry weight loss (78.7% after 14 d at 18°C) occurred with the addition of raw seawater sampled near benthic algal vegetation and containing only the natural microorganisms present. These consisted mainly of bacteria with different morphological properties, whereby their numbers alone (viable counts) could not be correlated with algal dry weight loss. Although no single dominant species could be determined, lemon yellow pigmented colonies were frequently found.

As chemical extraction processes do not distinguish between compounds originating from the alga and its associated microflora, a key step immediately prior to isolation of molecules, is elimination of epibionts from the alga studied. In chemical, ecological and biotechnological contexts, a clear identification of the source organism, when symbiotic interactions occurs, is crucial. We aimed to improve understanding of specific secondary metabolite production by macroalgae through development of a metho-dology for removing microbial epibionts immediately prior to chemical extraction without damaging algal cell surfaces (to avoid extraction of endogenous macroalgal compounds at this stage). Various solutions were tested: non-polar solvents (dichloromethane and hexane), alcohols (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol), oxidants (sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and iodine) and a natural product (tea tree oil) at various concentrations and contact times. Five macroalgal species were employed: Chondrus crispus, Fucus serratus, Palmaria palmata, Saccharina latissima and Ulva lactuca. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the surface integrity. The best epibiont removal rate without damaging tissue was obtained with mixtures of ethanol (40-50%) and sodium hypochlorite (1%). Interestingly, macroalgal moisture content influenced treatment efficacy.© 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2011.","2011","2024-02-08 14:53:48","2024-02-09 00:15:00","","457-469","","5","54","","Bot.

Extraction of secondary metabolites was carried out using different solvents to determine antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the dried extracts. The total phenolic contents of dried methanolic extracts were significantly different (p < 0.05). H. elongata exhibited highest phenolic content at 151.3 mg GAE/g of seaweed extract and also had the highest DPPH scavenging activity (p < 0.05) with a 50% inhibition (EC50) level at 0.125μg/ml of extract. H. elongata also had the highest total tannin and total flavonoid contents (p < 0.05) of 38.34 mg CE/g and 42.5 mg QE/g, respectively. Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microtitre method which allowed detection of bacterial growth inhibition at low levels. All methanolic seaweed extracts inhibited the food spoilage and food pathogenic bacteria tested; Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella abony, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, except C. crispus extracts. It was found that dried methanolic extracts of red and green seaweeds had significantly lower antimicrobial activity than the brown species; H. elongata had the highest antimicrobial activity with up to 100% inhibition. In the studied work, the antimicrobial activity of red and green seaweed extracts significantly increased when ethanol and acetone were used as extraction solvents (p < 0.05).

Microbes associated with kelp and other macroalgae play a critical role in processes such as nutrient exchange, chemical signaling, and defense against pathogens. Thus, manipulating the microbiome to enhance macroalgal growth and resilience is a promising, but largely untested, tool in sustainable kelp cultivation. The core microbiome hypothesis suggests that bacteria that are consistently found on a host (the core microbes) are likely to have a disproportionate impact on host biology, making them an attractive target for microbiome manipulation. Here, we surveyed wild Saccharina latissima and their surrounding environment to identify core bacterial taxa, compared to cultivated kelp, and experimentally tested the effect of cultured bacterial isolates on kelp development. We find that core bacteria are nearly absent in cultivated juvenile sporophytes in nurseries but eventually colonized after outplanting kelp to ocean farm sites. We find that bacterial inoculants can have both positive and negative effects on kelp development. In line with predictions from the core microbiome hypothesis, we find a positive correlation between the frequency of the bacterial genus in the wild and the bacterial effect on the number of sporophytes in kelp co-culture experiments. IMPORTANCE The core microbiome hypothesis suggests that symbiotic microorganisms consistently associated with hosts have functional effects on host biology and health. However, there is a lack of evidence to either support or refute this idea. This study surveys the distribution of bacteria on wild and cultivated kelp to identify the core microbiome and tests the ability of bacterial isolates cultured from the surface of wild kelp to influence kelp growth and development in laboratory microbial manipulation experiments. The frequency of bacterial genera on wild kelp was positively correlated with influence on kelp development in laboratory experiments, providing support for the core microbiome hypothesis.","2023-12-13","2024-02-08 14:54:40","2024-02-08 22:02:40","2024-02-08 14:54:40","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The resulting increase in low salinity events will be a source of stress for Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) and potentially Saccharina’s associated bacterial community. Bacteria are important to the health of their host because host-associated bacteria can facilitate or hinder host survival in stressful abiotic conditions. Therefore, understanding how bacteria change under abiotic stress is critical to our understanding of how host physiology will be affected by abiotic stress. In this study, sampled the bacterial community associated with Saccharina and the surrounding environment across two years of field sampling at four sites with contrasting salinity profiles around Vancouver, Canada during the 2021 and 2022 spring freshet (562 samples) coupled with salinity manipulation experiments in the lab repeated eight times in 2022, concurrently with field sampling (269 samples). Our illumina data show that salinity is a significant factor in shaping the overall bacterial community of Saccharina. We find significant increases in bacterial community diversity and paired with a significant reduction in the relative abundance of core bacteria in low salinity across lab and field data. Our findings suggest that host-filtering is significantly impaired in low salinity, raising questions surrounding how resilient some existing Saccharina populations may be to more intense and more variable freshwater influx.","2023-12-08","2024-02-08 14:54:52","2024-02-08 21:55:47","2024-02-08 14:54:52","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In the present study, a total of 39 seawater samples were collected during 3 months from three zones: Neoporphyra haitanensis cultivation zones (P), Gracilaria lemaneiformis-Saccharina japonica mixed cultivation zones (G), and control zones (C). These samples were then analyzed using 18S and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to ascertain the fungal and bacterial communities, respectively, along with the determination of environmental factors. Our results showed that increased dissolved oxygen (DO), decreased inorganic nutrients, and released dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seaweed cultivation zone predominantly altered the variability of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial communities. Certain microbial groups such as Aurantivirga, Pseudomonas, and Woeseia were stimulated and enriched in response to seaweed cultivation, and the enriched microorganisms varied across seaweed cultivation zones due to differences in the composition of released DOM. In addition, seasonal changes in salinity and temperature were strongly correlated with microbial community composition and structure. Our study provides new insights into the interactions between seaweed and microbial communities.","2022","2024-02-04 19:18:27","2024-02-09 00:22:12","2024-02-04 19:18:26","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","other_source; zot_refs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
